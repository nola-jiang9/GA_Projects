I don't know which one I would like to put in for however, I think I'd be great at both.

Current CAP 2 Leads and O/N leads what are the pros/cons of your shifts? Does cap 2 lead have rotating shifts? Also, at my store O/N TL currently make 24$/hr, no idea how much cap 2 makes, I assume 22$? Regardless... Pay isn't super important to me, just was curious!",1.0,1,14
walmart,1623476491,nxzndf,Finally promoted MYSELF to customer,"This is going to be a long one so buckle up, first I just wanna say how happy I am to have found Reddit to be able to talk about things others know about and relate to. Its really nice to have people on your side who get it lol. Now we all know that working for Walmart is absolute ass and I WILL not ever go back. 

I originally came from a store in CA and transferred to OGP. at first it was all great and I loved it, that only lasted a week or 2. After being treating horribly, yelled at every day, had sexual comments made to me and other co workers daily &amp; getting pulled in for a supposed coaching (which they never went through with because the “system was down” which that isn’t a thing) I had to get out of there. I was promoted to team lead over apparel. 

I’ve been over apparel for about 6 months now and I came from apparel in CA so I did have knowledge and I was very capable. I was incredibly happy about the pay increase because 18.36 an hour is decent and I felt like I had a good handle on things. Oh was I so naive, not only is the new store I’m working for the WORST store I have ever worked at, it’s also the most drama filled. 

Management has no idea what they are doing, they can’t ever communicate about anything and that makes it hard for us TLs because we will give one direction and then management will come along and change it up with no communication. So not only were the associates confused on what their actual job was, we never got things done the way the process was supposed to be. 

One of the associates I had is one of the worst people I have ever worked with and is constantly starting drama for no reason, yells at us and demands we do something for her the minute she asks for it. On top of that, she would text me constantly just being a bully and it was just all too much. 

Management had a rule that they had just told the associates and that was they were not to be texting or calling us (TLs) when we weren’t on the clock. So tell me why my coach would text me constantly while I’m not even there?? 

I had gone to the store lead about an issue that had been happening for a long time because according to the chain of command that is who I was supposed to speak to and instead of him taking me seriously, he went around the store saying that I didn’t know how to do my job and all I did was bitch an complain. 

There is SO much more I wanna write and vent about because I’m just not okay mentally after working there anymore &amp; I know this post is all over the place but tomorrow is my last day and I couldn’t be more excited to never have to go there as an associate EVER again because I refuse to be treated that way ever again. I got a new management position at a place I LOVE to shop at so hopefully this will be a good thing for me.

walmart,1623474356,nxz3pl,I'm frustrated and haven't been given the raise or backpay they promised in almost a month. I need some advice.,"So there's quite a bit to unpack and talking to management has walked me in circles. 

To start off I began a transfer right before our personnel coordinator moved stores we also got a brand new store manager who says he doesn't have his options available to him yet and we have yet to get a new coordinator. I moved from door to OGP which was SUPPOSED to be a nice raise and more hours. My personnel coordinator and OGP manager told me to go ahead and start working OGP the 21st of last month. I've been working OGP 40hrs weekly since then however I never got transfered or filled any paper work. They keep saying I'll get my back pay (mainly my OGP manager) and not to worry about it but the OGP manager refused to even try and help me fill out the transfer paper work confirming my new position until I talked to our SM. Then literally an hour later she had everything pulled up and ready for me to sign. Now I'm missing almost a months worth of pay for the raise and I haven't even gotten my pay bumped to the OGP raise because I need to wait for the new pay period? I should also add my OGP manager lied to me when I asked about the transfer request and said she couldn't help me and we'd have a new personnel coordinator by the end of the week last week (talked to the SM he said it'd be minimum another month and she KNEW THIS)

Long story short I'm debating just calling ethics hotline but idek if that'd do me any good. I have a bunch of bills to pay and had planned a bunch of future expenses around this raise and I want my money now they are saying it'll take another pay period just to receive my raise not even what I'm owed. 

What can I do? Do I even actually have any options?",1.0,1,13

Started looking into other jobs already and putting in, and just got the call from a vet clinic to fill the receptionist role. Yeah I’m gonna have to wake up super early now, but shit. I’ll be in AC, not doing ridiculous heavy lifting, all while getting paid the same.

walmart,1623427566,nxjj0p,Stuck on a LOA and I don't know what to do,"I am frustrated to the point of tears. All I want is to come back to work. My last leave was denied because I was unable to find a specialist provider in that time frame to fill out the necessary documentation. Management was aware of this and in the face of me languishing on an unnecessary LOA just for Sedgwick, told me to forget them and come back anyway. This was a mistake. My condition would reach crisis levels and necessitate hospitalization. 

Now I feel that I am well again but I'm in the same situation dealing with doctors. I got so frustrated I decided to pay out of pocket on a Telemedicine app promoted through the Wire, almost $300 when I'm hurting for cash, just to get these documents filled out. The aftercare the hospital set me up with was a joke. My PCP doesn't feel comfortable dealing with my condition and tells me to see the specialist, as if I'm not trying. 

So I see this guy yesterday. Again, all I want is the documents filled out so I can return to work. He tells me they must be sent through support. They tell me I have to sign a release and only on a computer, I don't even have a goddamn computer, but I borrow my roommate's. Silly me, I forget the password. No big deal, right?

i started working there when i was 17 (i'm 18 now) and i'd routinely get sexually harassed by customers. there was no way for me to bring this up with the store, so i pretty much just had to take it. 

i had this one coworker who'd routinely leave me alone (i worked in electronics) while he took an hour and half long break and/or a half an hour long 15. the company knew of this and did nothing. i would be alone for about 2 days during the evening shift each week, and alone for 3/4 of my shift on saturdays before they eventually hired more people. 

i was a minor and couldn't work past 9:30 p.m., so they hired another evening shift adult. he pulled pretty much the same thing as the other guy. i don't have problems confronting people, so i talked to both of them about their behavior and they changed nothing. the store knew about their behavior and did nothing. 

i've been followed around the store on the job, hit on by old men, and forced to deal with a lot of the departments in the store. i wouldn't really complain about this if they actually paid me the salary to be thrown around the store to do jobs that others get paid more to do.

walmart,1623415219,nxf1ae,Did I get the job? Please help!,"So a while ago I applied to Walmart in Laval, QC (Canada) for Merchandising Store Associate. I did an interview and it went great. The person interviewing me was glad to have me and seemed satisfied with my CV and everything. He mentioned that their department is desperate for employees since 5 people quit the week prior. 

Then when it was over he told me I should receive an email soon confirming that I got the job and I can start working right away when I get it. He said ""there's a problem with our system"" which automatically rejects candidates as soon as another is accepted even if there are multiple positions to fill. Because of that, candidates in line after the first accepted one will receive a rejection and an interview right after.

There was another girl interviewing at the same time as me and he said that she should receive her email first and I should receive it by Friday (it was a Wednesday).

On Friday, I hadn't received anything except for the rejection and interview. I was patient and waited until Sunday to call only to have the manager say ""there's a problem with the system, you'll get it by Monday or Tuesday. All I keep getting is the rejection and interview emails one after the other.
I got fed up and talked to a different manager in-person who said I'll receive a call but I haven't.

Assuming that 5 people got hired and I'm the last then I guess it makes sense to get 4 rejections; I just think it's weird that they're ""desperate"" and letting a faulty email system delay the process so much.

I have worked for Walmart before, at a Sam's Club, and I thought that the assessment was not graded but rather just an examination of what kind of person and or worker you are. Today I learned that this was not the case when I called into the local Walmart that I had applied to. They claimed that all five of my assessments had failed for all five positions that I had applied to. I am unsure of how or why I failed the assessments but as it stands, I will not be able to work at Walmart. And at this rate, considering how the whole scenario went, I do not really feel like going back to work for Walmart. I have a theory that Walmart has changed up its assessments, because I took the exact same assessments just a year ago (answering the same way mind you) and never failed anything.

So apparently it was because i didnt run seafood or put any meat in the bins so basically i didnt do anything for an eight hour shift. Im like okay thats BS im not gonna come in and do absolutely nothing. I said maybe it was a day with just me and one other person as we are extremely understaffed. And cap1 which one of these leads runs literally leaves 8-10 carts of produce stacked seven to eight feet tall everyday and tons of trash in meat along with at least half a pallet unprocessed and the rest of it on carts. 

So im like i dont agree with this and he said we can pull the cameras if you like. And ill admit ill take a 20 min break to smoke and shit since its so stressful here and the occasionally long shit. So i just said can i take this above you if i disagree at a later time and they said sure so i just said ill think on it and work harder if i did mess up basically. 

So today I dont have a tc 5 hours into my shift. About two hours ago im taking trash and the loss prevention or asset protection girls (2 of them) come up to me carrying a cart of cardboard to the back and say your coach(the team lead who coached me) is looking for you, said he saw you walk outside and disappear at 4 and hasnt seen you the last hour and a half. Usually he leaves at 4 and im like ok well ive been taking trash cap1 leaves everyday. Both of them were like yeah we were outside smoking with you just pop your head near him occasionally so he knows. So he had to go to them and ask them to search the cameras basically to find me which is fucking ridiculous.

All the front end loved me since I was great at register and especially the SCOs and was one of the few cashiers always friendly and patient with customers, so they were all surprised I got fired for something so trivial, even the people lead said it should’ve been a warning at least. I was only working part time since I wanted a job to get out of the house since I work an online chat support job mainly. The store manager wouldn’t really open door it and just said I was rehire-able in two months, and the front end coach and even the assistant manager who was there who terminated me who really likes me and my work ethic said they’d take me back.


Anyway, it’s been two months now, and I strangely do miss working there to interact with new people, and the people I worked with were really cool and I got along great with them. Even the front end team leads who I see a lot say they want me back and that I should put my application in. So I resubmitted my application and called the front end coach a day or two later (Sunday) and informed them I put an application in if they need cashiers. They said great, they’ll get with the store manager when they came in Monday and get back to me. This struck me as odd since I didn’t know they needed to talk with the store manager to hire people, thought it was the coach/people lead who did that. Didn’t hear anything Monday, so called Tuesday and spoke with the coach and they said they forgot and will try getting with the manager today (well, yesterday), and they’d call me back, probably not yesterday but today or tomorrow maybe, they didn’t really give a specific time when I asked. Still no call and I don’t wanna pester anyone, especially for a cashier job, but I don’t get why they’d have to speak with the manager. Even they said I could come back in two months. If I don’t hear back from them by Friday I’m considering calling the people lead who really likes me and is always willing to help, but would they be able to do anything? If only to maybe inquire and tell me why they need the store manager to have me come back.

walmart,1623263639,nw2vpa,Is there a hard rule on being required to wear your vest if you work outside in 90+ degree heat?,"I work out in garden center. 
Temps are currently reaching over 90 degrees, and it's only going to get worse.  Humidity is often high this time of year as well. 

For the last 2 seasons I worked, I was told that I could go without my vest while I'm working outside as long as 1.) My shirt follows dress code and 2.) I attach my name badge to my shirt.
So, I would go without my vest for most of the summer, for the last two years. I'd only wear it inside.

Now, I have a new team lead. And they are now telling me that im not allowed to remove my vest on the clock whatsoever. That I have to have my vest on and zipped at all times when I'm clocked in, even outside in the heat and humidity. That I could get coached for taking it off.

Is that true?? I honestly don't understand why it's such a big deal. That extra layer of fabric really kills me on hot days... not to mention it gets sweaty and disgusting literally every shift. Besides, the cart pushers don't wear vests... 

I'm already planning on asking my store manager about this, but is there somewhere on the wire or something that it's explicitly stated that I still cannot remove it even in the heat??",1.0,1,10

walmart,1623261440,nw21at,Long Vent (Homophobic TL),"I have a TL in apparel and she has very traditional views. We'll call her Tilly. I'm a woman and happen to work at walmart with my lover who is also another woman. She did the apparel processing while I work the floor. Tilly catches onto anything she can bite me for. She exaggerates her claims when taking me for formal chats and then tells me next time I'll be written up. I go tell her I'll be taking my 15 and she'll look at her watch and start timing me immediately whilst I'm standing there. I stopped telling her I'm taking 15s and tell fellow coworkers instead. We got an awesome new TL who is very accepting of me and my girlfriend, and she loves to chat with us and listens. We'll call her Sara. Sara makes jokes and makes sure she gets stuff done. Tilly thinks Sara is too friendly with everyone. Tilly and Sara pull everyone into the office one by one for a chat after they realized how much phone use is going on (we have 3 minors who use it often. I happen to be caught checking the time on it and Tilly points me as a problem.) The chat went okay at first, but later I regretted not recording it. As it went on, Tilly brought back up things that are months old to reprimand me on these things (she had been on vacation before this chat). Tilly would exaggerate things I did and Sara would have to occasionally correct her. Tilly made claims that I go to the backroom all the time to talk to my girlfriend simply because she can never find me on the floor. I told her I have no recollection of ever doing so. I am around in the apparel department doing my work. She claimed that she saw me and my girlfriend sitting at fitting room talking for 15 minutes. That really bugged me because that was clearly an exaggeration of this very morning. I tried to correct her because she wasn't even around for those self-proclaimed whole ""15 minutes"". I tried to tell her I was there with my girlfriend because I had a question and she answered it for me. It never lasted 15 minutes. Tilly just walked by during and that was it. When I did try to tell Tilly that, she said she was gonna call bull on that. That got me livid, but I kept calm. She then asked what I had needed help with. I told her and she called more bull because I should know how to do it. I told her my witness and said to go talk to them, they can vouch for it and she suddenly calmed down and said she believed me. I was SO confused.

I'll end it there, but it was a long chat. It wasn't the first one, but Sara was there this time. I already knew Tilly didn't like gay people so whatever. Me and my girlfriend are talking to Sara later the next day and the office chats came up. My gf mentioned to Sara that Tilly is traditional and doesn't like gay people and Sara said everything suddenly clicked together for her. She was actually distraught because she hadn't realized homophobia was the reason. Cue us being confused, then Sara told us that Tilly was completely different with all the other associates. Calm and understanding. My gf was upset by this because it shows us just how much harder Tilly is treating us because we're dating. Sara was upset as well. This happened last month in May, but since then, as of recent, I heard Tilly is switching with another TL and moving upfront. I'll also be switching departments soon hopefully. It sucks that this happens, but I'm not going into that office for anything unless I can audio record. Sorry this was very long, but thanks for sticking around.",1.0,1,27

walmart,1623187980,nvf4zw,"""No, you are NOT getting that swimsuit.""","Okay, here's the story behind why I got stuck in apparel the other night.  Amazing how stubborn kids can be. 

Lady comes up, has her kids with her. The girls were like 5 and maybe 10-11 (pre-teen). The girls have several suits they want to try on, okay fine. The first ones they tried on were those little mermaid like suits, nope those sucked (trust me, mom was right). So back in they go, second set of suits. Older girl loved hers (some sort of orange leopard print), too big on the little one. Nope to both. Back in. 

At this point it gets interesting. The younger one tried the rest of hers on, one at a time, none fit per mom. Younger girl is okay with that and comes out to wait. 

The older girl - oh no, she wanted that second suit. So she tries on the third one, nope, comes back out in the second suit. Mom"" No, I already said no."" Rinse and repeat for the next two suits. Every other time she came out she had on that second suit. After the fourth time, Mom calls dad, puts him on Facetime (because of course pre-teen is going to come out in HER suit) and is ready. 

Girl comes out, Dad's on Facetime, makes her turn around, and says the same thing. ""NO!"" 

Finally she gives up, gets back into what she wore into the store and come out with the suit she could not have. 

While she was doing that, I had 3 other people come up, try on what they had and left. I had time to browse the wire while waiting for her to get done. Also, little brother is autistic, so Mom (who I swear had the patience of the saints) was keeping him entertained the entire time.

To the people who zone and those who so curbside shopping. You are awesome. Because of this community I put stuff back where I find things.

Little story yesterday  I went  to my local Walmart for a monitor and a stapler. Most monitors were out but the one I wanted the least bc of the price was in. I went to look for the stapler but got distracted by the notebooks as usual ,found an updated planner. ( I am trying to stay on schedule but most of the time ,I fall on it and the planner expires on me ) so I look for its family so I can see the price, nowhere to be found not even a similar cousin. So I used the app scanner thingy to get the price which I did get but the app also told me the item I was holding in my hand was out of stock. 

I still work in service so I still get the mean customers and others stuff but now I feel your pain when it comes to zoning and misinformation about stock.

Thank you guys from a fellow service gal.",1.0,1,5

So I turned in my new availability a month ago and finally today they tell me it had been denied because “my shift doesn’t happen during that time” (I think I had it as 8-3) and “they don’t understand why I can’t work nights during the summer.” Even tho I explained I am taking 3 summer classes and need the time in the evenings to study and work with my classmates and be able to get off early enough to do that. 
In addition, my team lead is having another person be moved to days as well in hopes of having both a day team and evening team and the SM approved for that.

walmart,1623044022,nu4xov,So.,"Yep.


My store is understaffed, overworked and led down a path of sheer mediocrity. 

Our store manager is incompetent, all but three team leads are absolute imbeciles. (One is just temporary.)

And workplace morale is nonexistent.

We were told:

""You're the backbone of our store.""

And in the same breath just a few seconds seconds later:

""You're easily replaceable.""

By someone who's not even our overnight manager.

Everyone who's a manager is someone the Store Manager personally likes or saved from firing by bringing them to our store. As a result, we're hilariously understaffed and thus overworked.


We barely have enough people for our dairy or frozen sections and we barely get two people in there to throw a 1600 piece truck. Several coworkers said they had been told to throw 50+ boxes an hour or they will be coached for productivity. That people are begging for our jobs and the only reason they're not here doing amazing work that we're seemingly incapable of doing is because of management's sheer benevolence and mercy upon us, to allow us to work and provide for ourselves and families.


Our overnight shift has 2 TLs and only 1 is worth a shit at all. If it wasn't for him, everything would fall apart.

Our overnight  Coach is absolutely worthless. She's barely there and when she is there, she does nothing. Literally.

This is no exaggeration.

New people are barely hired and immediately  put in grocery and only want to do grocery and nothing else, they complain about being cold and perform extremely  poor when outside of grocery or zoning. 

Or they just quit.


We're also throwing the whole store and whatever mess CAP2 leaves us to do. Which is usually something unreasonable as they only scan pick carts, they don't put them out. Everyday CAP2 is sitting inside the breakroom at 9:20/9:30 and the isles are a mess and I've seen frozen and dairy pallets even blocking the entrance because they couldn't be bothered to move pallets 10 feet further.  I've seen top stock carts with open food and snack wrappers all over them just in the isle. I've seen them  turned over in aisles and customers walking around them as 2nd shift just relaxes in the breakroom or talking by end CAPs, free to do whatever now that the backbone of the store is here to clean up whatever mess they've created.

If I'm a clown for working here, then this store must be a whole fucking circus.

walmart,1623024677,ntzdt6,VizPick training,"So I guess I have some questions, I'm looking more for REASONS, I truly want to understand how it works.

After something is picked if it is truly still overstock you need to print a new vizpick label? Some say yes, some say no. Why? Why some stores saying one and some saying the other and what exactly does it change in the process if you do or don't. I guess it is still picking for topstock and out topstock is always 100 percent full, so this is a common problem for us.

Vizpick label gets screwed up in the printing process somehow. It is torn up, lost, what ever. You need to print another label. Some say you just print another. Same say that screws up counts and you have to print the EXACT label. Sure I know you can print the exact label again, but how do you know the number for that label? Especially if a different person doing it at a different time? Manger 1 prints a Vizpick label. Somehow the label doesn't get on the box. Manger 2 takes over an hour or so later for what ever reason, comes across the same overstock box and prints a label for the box. What breaks down in the process if you just print a new label?

Coinciding with the previous question. What happens if someone just prints like 4 Vizpick lables for a box but they were only supposed to print 1. They don't know what they are doing, are untrained, maybe hooked up to the wrong printer (I've seen this happen before). After 36 hours those 3 extra ""cases"" that were printed will add to the salesfloor count erroneously, do I have that correct? 

What happens if things are just grabbed out of bins. Most common scenario - team associate is asked by customer to grab something in the backroom. So they do, they don't vizpick they just grab it.",1.0,1,23

   I only work weekends because I am a college student. My schedule has been like this for 9 months. Recently school ended and while I am now in summer school there was a time period of two weeks where i wasn’t in school so I was just picking up shifts when I could. 

  Now i requested off for every weekend in august for school obligations like trainings and things (my uni is out of town) &amp; i asked my dep manager about accepting my requests off.  Well apparently the store manager walked in on him looking at it and said that “i only work weekends and now I’m basically making my own schedule by picking up shifts when i want, and told him not to accept my requests off because if there’s something i need to do i can do it during the weekend.”  

Now he says I have to talk to the S.M about the requests because he’s not allowed to approve it atm.

 I am aware that i can request an educational leave for the month but looking ahead I have a trip planned for November that’s already paid for and he’s acting as if it’s going to get rejected simply because I only work weekends.

There are two types of kiosks. One allows you to get your 4 x 6 prints right then and there. The other sends the information to our side of the counter where we print the photos out and which can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour depending on how busy we are. The instant photos cost 29 cents each while the one hour photos are 9 cents apiece. Do 100 photos and that is a $20 difference in cost.

We often try to let our customers know about this when they pay for their order so maybe they can save some money the next time. Unfortunately, our good deed sometimes falls flat as the customer, 100% being women, immediately start to whine that no one told them this when they were doing the photos and that a manager needs to take care of them.

OK, Karen, here's the deal. Fuji changed the software so now there is a page with two large boxes clearly showing the prices and time involved. And you ***cannot*** go to the next page without marking one of the boxes. Showing the person this, and in the nicest way possible, only infuriates the women.

walmart,1623009341,ntu2zb,second day and i already want to quit,"writing this as im on my way to my second day lol. 
im 18 and this is my first job, i applied for night stocking bc the pay would've been enough to help me move out but i was instead begged to work in electronics because it's understaffed even though it's $13.50 an hour and not the like $18 with night stocking. even though it's really expensive to live alone in my town so i wouldn't afford it with that, i was fine with that at the time because i was just really excited to work and everything seemed so fun at the orientation, but i know absolutely nothing about electronics and yesterday i already had so many customers be mean to me for not knowing where something is or not understanding what keys work for which case yet.

i work closing though and when it got to be really late at night it wasnt that bad, it was just me and another worker there and he was pretty helpful and showed me how to close up, but what really turned me off of working here even more was seeing him get straight up bullied by other coworkers. after that he opened up to me about how it's making him want to switch jobs, the associates are meaner than the customers. i have pretty bad anxiety and i was hoping working would get me more used to people but now im scared of mean customers AND associates... 

also, because it's my first job, my parents were really excited for me and i feel like if i quit they'd be really disappointed. i just really don't feel like this will get any better for me, especially when seeing people say that on here 😭 ive also never quit a job before because this is my first so im anxious about how to handle that. my therapist also said this definitely wouldn't be a right fit for me mentally and recommended i apply at the local gardening center or something else more calm.

basically, how would i go about quitting? or should i just suck it up lmao",1.0,1,13

My lead told me that I don’t “need” my breaks today and that I have to take a half lunch because I called out yesterday. I know people would immediately assume she’s joking, but she told me this with full seriousness, not in a teasing manner at all. I don’t think this would be allowed, right? My shift was covered for the ppto, I didn’t cal out just to be out but because I was unwell, and your breaks/lunches don’t carry to the next days. I think she’s mad bc they have her doing freight and she hates that, so my guess is she’s just in a mood today. 

Do I make a complaint or take this higher? Because if it isn’t allowed, I wanna tell her to put that shit in writing with her signature or I’m taking my full breaks/lunches, I’m sure she would know if she’s violating something and is banking on the fact I’m not sure if she is.

walmart,1623007926,nttk58,Walmart Pro-Tips: How to unload any size truck in LESS than two hours!,"I had a manager decide to throw the 2800 case truck one day just to prove it could be done in two hours. I was a CAP supervisor at the time. He started before I got there and got to the front of this trailer in about 1h 45mins. 

How did he do this?

He literally only unloaded one side of the trailer; reasoning that getting the truck ""done"" only required the belt to reach the front of the trailer. There was still freight to the ceiling on half of the vehicle! This manager finished in time to strutt out of the trailer just as my associates were arriving for their 2PM shift. He points at the trailer, declares that he just unloaded 2700 cases in less than two hours, and strolled straight over to SM's office (presumably to brag).

I had to hold my tounge until he was gone. I brought my asocates into the trailer and explained that they should never unload this way. If that manager had an accident or some other medical emergency resulting from a cave-in, it would take forever to reach them.  We ended up spending another 45 minutes unloading the rest of the freight. Thanks for showing us how it's done, boss!",1.0,1,14

I have been promoted to nearly every job I've worked at , I really enjoy working quite a lot!!! :( 

It's great, but I've got a lot of mental health related problems, BP II, PTSD, ADHD, etc, and they seem to happen a lot in the summer  - I missed work once (technically a no call no show), came in late another day but showed up - at that point, I would've had 7.5 points (I guess I had more points than I thought? a few more because I was a minute off from the time clock) but I explained my manager it was disability related and he said he'd put the points on hold to get the disability stuff figured out. I gave my manager an official list of my diagnoses to verify, said it'd clear things up, thought I would be settled and my total would be back to 3.5 points. (apparently, I've worked long enough that I can use PPO to help remove some of those points, I submitted a request this morning so I'd get one less today). 

But I ended up missing work again, to beyond upset with myself, and got an email from workday stating ""Notify (my name) of Terms of Employment Notice"" and am wondering if at this point I'm going to be fired? I am going to check in with my manager and let him know that I'm seeking disability and really like working here, it's just a rough time for me, and if I have to be let go of I understand but it would be particularly crushing :( Very disappointed in myself, understand that part of this is my own responsibility and I am just another human and easily replaceable but I'm hoping this works out.

It wouldn’t be so bad if they would had better air conditioning, which leads to my second point.

The utter fact that the backroom has zero air conditioning is disgusting. How are we supposed to get our job as efficient as possible when we are sweating up a storm with warm water to cool us down?

I work all the nights (other than my days off), and so when the Ecommerce Department Manager Leaves at 230, all the department duties fall to me, and I am fine with that. Recently our orders went from 20ish a day, to 90 a day due to a covid spike. Obviously is was a big dip for us, and after the first two weeks, we finally got into a rythm. 


Anyways, I digress. The point of this post. I had a OMNI nightmare. 

I was out on the floor doing other work, and decided to go check on my team, and when I got there it was chaos. Orders were on the floor, and my team looked panicked. One of my associates. Was running out an order, but before he left he slapped a phone in my hand. I looked down and saw that three people were here and they had been waiting anywhere near 150minutes to 240 minutes. I panicked and my assistant manager on duty, and my store manager appeared outta nowhere. Me and one of my other associates got the two orders ready, and ran out to the cars with the store manager and assistant manager behind us. We got to the cars and the managers just stood there with the drivers whole my associate and I unloaded about 15 totes each. 

When we went back inside, i tried to figure out what had happened, and my managers just went back to the office. And suddenly it was the next day. I come in and go down the online grocrey room and there is a new list with names. And it said that my assistant manager was to be down here at all times underneath his name, and then what associates would be down here. And at my name, it said (exact words) just an associate. I was crushed, cause in my waking life I am trying to move up. I went home and bawled my eyes out, then I woke up from my dream.

I worked there for about 6 months and quit right as I went to finish my sophomore year, and I hated the job so much. Scanning the items, weighing and identifying the fruits, and bagging them were fine, but it was always paying for it that usually was the issue. There some unique issue the customer has that I don't know how to fix, so I have to get a manager, which backs up the line, pisses people off, etc

When I quit, I never intended to work with Walmart again, but when I was looking for a new job after working my last job for 2+ years, I saw they had an opening for a stocker position at Walmart. Considering I had lost 110 pounds in the past year and am as active as ever, I figured a more active job would be perfect, and I was totally correct! The work is active but at the same time calm, and since you don't have to interact with many customers, you can plug one ear with an earbud and listen to music or, in my case, a podcast.

I enjoy being a stocker 100x more than being a cashier at Walmart, and thats not even considering the base $2 an hour increase in pay. Obviously being a stocker isn't perfect, but I would much rather take its shitty moments over a cashiers shitty moments.

I'll be graduating with my B.S. soon, and plan to pursue a Master's and possibly a PhD in linguistics/computational linguistics, but I need a job to support myself in the mean time and while I do pursue those degrees.

walmart,1622959027,ntexia,Hypersensitive Team Lead worries no one likes them so they repeatedly fuck over the associate who actually respected them.,"""Sorry I dumped you off in apparel without any help today! Teehee!""

Oh, it's totally fine! You only ignore everything I suggest to make my job a little bit less miserable, knowing how unhappy I am here. I must just need to see a therapist. 

This has been going on for months. You would rather assign three guys to fuck up cosmetics on a one truck night than let me do it on my own and get it done the right way because you think I can't mentally handle it and then you tell other managers to make sure I work apparel on days when you're not there, because again, you would rather put someone with a lot of anxiety somewhere they aren't comfortable working and deal with customers who are twice as ignorant than let them work somewhere they do well and know everything because you have an agenda. 

Months ago, I agreed to process apparel on the weekend because it kept me off the salesfloor. I don't know how that translated to ""dump her in apparel by herself with little to no instruction, no scanner, and no keys so customers can call her useless all day"", but I straight up told this person two days ago apparel isn't working for me.

I've been here for nearly five years and almost every manager I've had up until the last six months has been able to work something out with me, whether it be my schedule, where I work, or who I work with. 

For example, they leave me alone in a department I find to be overwhelming but when I say I work cosmetics better by myself, they don't let me. 

Don't come and try to hunt me down after work asking me ""do you want to talk about it? 🥺"" when you do everything you can to make sure I hate it here more than I already do, thinking I'm just going to lose my nerve every time just because you approach me with a sympathetic tone.

I have no problem with being friends with you or talking to you, but don't think you're going to manipulate me into letting you fuck me over on a daily basis. 

Yes, my personal life fucking sucks but don't use that information to invalidate how I feel as an employee. I do not need to see a shrink, I've made a few modest suggestions to make my job a little more bearable that were not only ignored but you did the polar opposite.

This manager is always feeling some way about how nobody likes them but the one associate who trusted, confided in them, and didn't judge them they screw over all the time and it's not cool. If you care that much what your employees think of you, at least try to make them a little happier.",1.0,1,4

i also remember something about how coaches can only override when people come in and under short notice (at least that's how the two stores i've worked at operated), and that other coaches cannot touch your schedule.

i work ogp &amp; weirdly enough, about two saturdays ago, a random coach from another department decided to screw with my schedule 17 HOURS BEFORE THE START OF THAT GIVEN SHIFT.

if this isn't making any sense, i was not scheduled for a saturday, come to find out towards the end of my shift (8am-5pm) the day prior, that coach suddenly decided to schedule me for that saturday. the time it was put onto my schedule was about two hours before the end of my shift and i wasn't notified about it until an hour after my shift was over (according to the me@walmart app). i didn't actually know i was supposed to go in until a friend texted me about why i wasn't at work. 

i just want to know how any of this is okay??? they literally tell us to notify them about any schedule changes 24 hours beforehand, but random coaches we don't even know can 1) fuck with our schedules and 2) do it under that 24 hour mark?????cause now i've got to suffer with a point because of that incident. 😐

I called them back after two days of submitting my application and they basically hired me on the spot (I had an over the phone interview) came to orientation and it all seemed ok. I was scheduled to work the next day(I was hired as OGP) without any actual training. However the manager said she didn’t have time to take me to the back room and I didn’t know where it was Bc I didn’t have a tour of the store Bc I didn’t have an actual interview, so I spent my entire first day (8 hours) behind a computer doing the CBLs. 

Next day I was thrown into the OGP back room and trained for literally 10 min, they gave me a TC, and was told good luck. It was horrible, I kept making mistakes and kept being talked to in a condescending manner (wtf do they expect I just got hired and did not get properly trained!!!). I finished the day tired as hell and I went home straight to sleep. Next day was alright but I swear workers are so rude and talk to you like you’re dumb for no fucking reason. For example, I told the asm that I was leaving for the day and she stopped me and told me that she needed to have a talk with me and told me that some other employee said I was talking too much and I was being too chatty. Bro I’m new and I’m tryna make friends or at least acquaintances. I’m sorry for talking when it is slow??? And I know who it is Bc I saw her snitch on another associate. Not to mention that they treat the back room and dispensing as if it was the Literal fucking emergency room. We had a rush yesterday and it was manageable but these associates were acting as if it was life or death if we didn’t get the orders in before 5 min.

Also, I was starting to get the hang of it and then I come in the next day and our regular asm isn’t there and everything is different. I got told that they operate differently when the asm isn’t there Bc they don’t like her system. And it makes it so hard. Under the other system it’s easy and the orders are easy to find but under the different one they don’t scan the column where the totes are and when a customer comes it’s fucking chaotic and stressful to find the tote.

This is where both of them screwed up. They then told me told me they know my schedule and I should be doing more to make them look good. 
Told them it was interesting that if you knew my schedule then why did you ask at the beginning of this discussion what I was doing the last 2 days?
 They both paused and one of them pulled out a vap pen and started smoking in front of me. 
Then told them if you want to make yourselves look good the start respecting them instead of trying to set them up from your mistakes. I walked away after that and reported to eithics.

walmart,1622912567,nt0976,"So after two years of working at Walmart, I decided to put in my two-week notice of resignation.","So I come on here to lurk on this subreddit and never really engaged but after two years of me working at Walmart and for the most part, it has been an enjoyable experience and a learning experience as well. But after a while, it has been a nightmare for me, one of the many reasons why I'm going to quit is the lack of hours and sometimes I would get removed from the schedule like I never existed and the constant harassment with my coach and some coworkers and the constant favorism that occurs in the back room (I work as Cap 2). The favoritism is so bad where I work that many people have quit because of it and according to what I know corporate knows and have not done anything to stop it. 

Keep in mind before making assumptions yes I have reported the altercations to HR, the Store Manager, and even the Market Manager and they still have done nothing. I even shown them evidence and it's not enough and some even shrug it off. So after two years of working at Walmart, I will finally put in my two-week notice, and to be honest, I really don't want to do it. But I had enough and the worse thing about it is that I'm in school and they don't want to work with me and ironically others who are in school who are not in Cap Team 2 have switched to better days and a better schedule. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it sucks that I have to quit. But when doing it I will try and talk to the Store Manager again and see what I can do and what can change. I hope I do not have to leave. But if nothing changes then I will turn in my two-week notice.

walmart,1622900766,nsw2tz,Point accumulation on event date,"Sorry if this has become a reoccurring question, but the point system is a grey area for me.

Memorial weekend just passed and my brother had to call in on that Saturday, he had 3.5 points before then and only had three hours of PTO saved up. Theres always talk about event dates, or whatever name variants, counts as two points but on the event list posted in the back it didn’t show that weekend as an event day. Not even Memorial Day itself. I get we’re supposed to be responsible for “knowing the key dates” but I hadn’t even realized the date at all till Monday morning as I was leaving. He didn’t either. I asked my team lead the next day about what days were counted as events that weekend and he said Saturday through Monday. My brother says the points haven’t shown up yet, granted they rarely pop up within the pay period (whether that’s a system issue or a management issue that’s up for debate) and now it’s the start of a new pay period so if they do show up I don’t think he can put anything in to cover at this point. Or more so if it would cover the point. 

My main question is more so about how many points you can accumulate. I’ve heard since I started there that it’s no more than 5, but I’ve known many who have gone above that without getting terminated, at least not from attendance. My brother has worked there for almost 3 years, never had any issues with management or been coached, never a warning about job quality or attendance from management, but he’s gotten pretty close a few times with point from calling in. He’s a bit anxious about it now since he didn’t know it was an even day and he doesn’t know what could be done. 

Is this enough for potential termination? Could he simply be given a warning about attendance and be on thin ice? Or is it more up to management discretion how to move forward? Maybe it’s just at my store but you never seem to be able to get a straight answer about jack from any higher ups and winging it only gets so far.",1.0,1,2

Hi fellas, I had an accident at walmart yesterday at 4:48 AM or so, I work overnights (ON TA Stocking) I started April 13. I was stocking grocery on the pasta aisle, facing the top stock cart and I fell back and hit my head/neck and back with all the shelves behind me and blackout/passed out (lol), when I regain conscioness I was in the floor and I co-worker that passed by saw me on the floor and asked if I was fine, I said ""yes, Im alright"" but the the rest of the night/morning I felt horrible, pain and really, really irritable (cuz of the pain) I was rushing to finish on time, and even acted out of frustration, like I spaped , then my team lead asked me what was going on, I finally vented my rant/pain/fustration, u see I told him when I fell, and after that, a little while, I went to unload cartboard into the bailer and he asked me how everything was going on the floor, I told him everything just flowing as usual, and told him my incident and he asked me if that was gonna happen every night, that we have to be aware of time/ pallets all this bs we already know and since we're short-staffed (""wondering why!!"") and that's when I flipped/snapped! So I kept working but really, really agressively, trowing shit up, stoking shit, you know, fast but with a feeling of ""fnck this life sucking mofo!!"" and then on break, I was like siting down and just venting/ranting on my own, ppl asked me what was going on, I told em, but I was like boiling water ( I never get this way). Anyways at the end of my shift (by 7 AM) I talk to my TL and told him everything and we go and start a accident/incident claim ( of course he didn't know the fnck to do it) so he went and ask the personnel lady (she knew but shw could care/give a fnck about it) so she told him to ask one of the more experienced team leads on the mornings, so he did and we went and did the process, took like 45 mins. Then the nurse sugested me to called 911, cuz I passed out while working when I hit my head/neck/back and I told her that I could just drive to the ER, which I did, they made a CT of my head, everything is okay, but they didn't do shit for my back pain, no x-rays, no- blood work, they gave me a work comps note for my employer to comply with the ER diagnosis and prognosis and a day off (lol! I fncking day, like I was alright!) so I just went to my GP and they gave me a no work until MD release, so I went back to walmart and asked the Store Coach/manager ( one of them) about my claim number and stuff, he said personnel lady is on the back, (she wasn't) then the coach was over there in their silly office eating or whatever and he gave me walmart cmi or whatever is called (this happened before I went to my gp). So my gp told me that until we figure out why I keep fainting/blacking out while at work (even walking lol!), like run some tests, I should not go back to work. So I went back to walmart, and the coach/manager told me as long as I am dealing with cmi/segweck and this injury/accident/incident, I should just call-in, and let em know whenever I get cmi/segweck or whatever worked out. So today later (actually on monday) on the day I will call cmi and see what's going on, also I will go monday to walmart if today or tomorrow the personell lady is not there, then may be a team lead (one that I am under their management) is there and give em a copy of my ER stay and my gp note, and ask for my claim # and his phone number to have it handy and tell em to take me out of the schedule until further notice.

So basically am asking what is the next step(s) from now on? I called in for first time yesterday because of the nature of my circunstances/inciddent/accident. So what's going to happen now, what do I do to get this straight up, all I want is medical care taken care of, and some compensation of I won't be able to go back to work till I get better.

walmart,1622824141,ns96wf,Disciplinary Action,"I have worked for Walmart just 2 months shy of 4 years and have not been coached once until today and have a question about the coachings when it comes to transfers.

On Tuesday night ( I work night shift) I was scheduled to work from 10pm to 6am with a 1 hour lunch and 2 15 minute breaks. I had a task time of 6:20 giving me a 10 minute buffer between work and clocking out. I managed to get all of the frozen freight done and cardboard cleaned up before I left leaving the overstock that I couldn't label (Had to share equipment since no one ever returns theirs when they are done at my store)  and one pick cart that evening shift picked and left for overnights to do. 

When they called me into the office just last night they said they were coaching me for that Tuesday night saying that they had to send me help to be able to finish my freight and when I clocked out at 6am like I was supposed to they wrote that I ""Worked 7 hours in frozen dept, clocked out at 6am leaving his overstock, cleaning, and the zone for another associate to after sending him help to finish freight."" Now I am no math wizard but I'm pretty sure I was only on the sales floor for 6:30 and I finished the freight that came  in that night and cleaned up the cardboard that I had on pallets/carts before I left to clock out. I told my TL that I had a few overstock carts in the freezer that needed to be labeled/binned (In what little space there was left) and a pick cart that had to be worked still. All done within my 6:20 task time and was still coached for ""not completing my work in my task time."" They sent me 1 co-worker at around 5:15-5:30am to try to make it go a little faster but he managed to stock about 15-20 cases at most that I still could have finished before I had to clock out.

Am I correct in saying that this coaching is complete bs or am I in the wrong somehow?

In the associate behavior section of the form they put ""Didn't met task time. Causing another associate to have to do more work than was given other tasks for the night bring morale of associates down."" Word for word what they put in. But if I'm not mistaken I finished my freight and cleaned my cardboard which is all that is included in the task time. One of the TLs that was sitting in on the meeting said that the pick cart is also added into the task time which from what a assistant manager that works at another store told me isn't true which makes me feel like they are just fishing for things to coach people on.

Is this a valid coaching or am I being screwed over here?

Also feel it's worth mentioning that I have been trying to transfer stores for a few months now and they are aware as one of them asks me the status on the transfer every so often.  So I'm not also worried that this is going to affect my ability to transfer to a TL position that a trusted assistant manager wants me to take.",1.0,1,5

Tonight, a coworker of mine called to inform me that our store's inventory is being bumped up to August, rather than it's regular September-November, and that our manager said this may impact some people's vacations in the months of June through August. Our manager is also scheduled to go on vacation right around the same time as me and said people without enough PTO would be running into some issues.

walmart,1622779969,nrw9um,Teaming Hours Question,"Some background: I'm one of the few who front-end associates at my store that's on the 2-11 shift and closes every night. I've been doing this for several months and one of the first things I've learned is that it cannot be closed until all customers are out of the building. Typically this means I'm at least 10 minutes over every night, sometimes a bit more. My record so far is 33 minutes over.

&amp;#x200B;

Leading up to Teaming, I was given a call from a coach asking if I wanted to opt in. They explained that I would be guaranteed 40 hours a week without any hour cuts. Ever since it's gone into effect I've only been scheduled for a single 40 hour week, which happened to be the first week of the new system. All weeks since then have been 39 hours. I can only figure their reasoning is that staying over to close means I'll end up with about 40 hours any given week. My pay usually does include a very slight amount of overtime.

&amp;#x200B;

Mainly what I wanted to ask about is if it's right that I'm only being scheduled for 39 hours? It doesn't seem right to me that I'm effectively having an hour cut to avoid overtime. It'd be more reasonable to either be paid overtime or be allowed to leave when I'm scheduled to leave, I'd think. But this is that place after all.

walmart,1622758876,nrpo0s,Oof I’m definitely in trouble,"OGP has been pretty behind on orders today since they’re doing this weird ass thing with the key. I get stuck outside for like 5 minutes until someone decides to unlock the door.

I asked at about 4:26 if I could take my last 15 since I leave at 6. The associate in charge was like “yeah just take out this order first”

When I came back she talked to the manager and he said I couldn’t go since we were behind. I told her “hey, I don’t give a shit about this place or how behind we are. I’m taking my last break”. She got all pissy and started calling the manager so I took out a few more orders at at 5 snuck out for my last break. 

I mean it’ll be bad if I got fired, but being behind is the worse reason you could give me to skip a break. It’s not my damn fault Walmart refuses to try to keep their associates. You want me to work hard, give me a work hard wage.

So i decided to reapply, no big deal. The one closest to me is starting to hire for the position i held at my old walmart, so i applied for that position, and numerous other positions. Failed the assessments for my old position, and every other position i applied for except a supervisory position, so now, even though the guy in the same position as my old manager wants to hire me to do the same job i did at my previous Walmart, I can't be hired to do so because i ""failed the assessment"". He's already talked to my old boss, and my old boss told him i was one of the best workers he's had in the past year. I just can't get hired because of a failed assessment.

walmart,1622757342,nrp3x4,What's Been Some Of Your Greatest Hits (customer stories recently),"I don't know what it is, but it seems that almost every annoying, rude, condescending, psychotic customers have come out in full force!  Perhaps its because the weather is nicer, but I am betting it's because Covid mandates are lessening in a lot of the country.

Some of my greatest hits

1. Last week was getting ready to cash a check for a customer &amp; he seriously looks at me &amp; asks if I had a shotgun behind SD.  I am like WHAT?  Then he says so he can go crazy on people.  Again I am like WHAT!!!!!????  Then he looks at me &amp; says well I wouldn't use it on you people (I assume he meant Walmart workers but still?)  Apparently he quit his job, but you don't joke about that kind of stuff anymore.
2. The two Karens (not sure if it was a grandma &amp; granddaughter) that wanted to load $2,700+ on their American Express Bluebird card, but it only let me load $1999.00 &amp; wouldn't allow me to do a second transaction.  Of course grandma gets pissed &amp; asks why.  Well maybe you lose out on certain luxuries since the card doesn't have fees?  How do I know?  Maybe research the card before you fucking buy it.  Apparently they're trying to buy a rental house for vacation.  She asked if she could try another Walmart &amp; I said probably not we all run on the same software.  What does she do she leaves &amp; then comes back &amp; asks to take the money off the card.  Well the Bluebird card doesn't allow it so she goes ballistic.  Then she said she would buy something &amp; then return it for cash.  Well it would go back on the card which again she doesn't like.  So then for around 10-15 minutes I get to hear them bitching at the poor person over the phone that works for Bluebird.
3. The customer who came up to me at SD to bitch that we have the dividers on deodorant to shop shoplifters!  Oh no!  How dare we try to keep products on the shelf so you don't have stinky armpits.  She just kept shouting that it was ridiculous.  Yeah it's ridiculous until you've watched videos of people literally wiping out shelves of products to resell.
4. I answer the phone to help out fitting room when we don't have anyone scheduled there or if I'm not busy &amp; I had one lady I literally wanted to curse out!  I told her I was trying to get someone to answer her question &amp; she started yelling that she wanted the store manager.  It's not my fault the entire store is working on freight or in a service area.  I even told her to order it as pickup today that way she could have it for sure since the website said it was in stock.  She then tells me she's a nurse &amp; that she shouldn't get out of the website she was using for work.  Well maybe don't call when you're on THE FUCKING CLOCK!  Does the phone still say to not call because associates are busy stocking?  I wish we could enforce that.  Her life &amp; death question was about a fucking household appliance.  Makes me wonder if people call into her health area if she treats them as disrespectfully as she treated me.
5. People trying to return stuff they've had for 2-3+ years.  I had someone try to return a Christmas sweater they bought in 2019!  Sorry we're not a pawn shop &amp; this is not Let's Make A Deal.  Sometimes if the item is still pristine &amp; it's still in the system I'll return it if the customer has a receipt &amp; do it without a receipt &amp; give store credit.  If it's clothing oh hell no!
6. A lady trying to pick up money today &amp; she had all the info wrote down.  Usually that's one clue that they don't know who they're picking up money from or even when sending.  I asked if she knew them &amp; she said just barely.  I was like huh?  She started screaming &amp; ran out of the store.
7. I have a long line at SD &amp; I look out in the vestibule from the desk &amp; see a middle aged man shaking his bag full of coins at me.  I said do you need help?  He said yeah!  Ok but I can't help you do you see my long line?  Luckily someone got a manager to go out there.  Sure buddy let me jump off my line of people waiting to go out &amp; assist you.",1.0,1,14

Two weeks passed, I had a negative test result. I was all set to return to work. However, I have to care for the family member with COVID now, as they return from the hospital. I had contacted Sedgwick and it seemed to qualify under the COVID leave, but would downgrade to a level 1 from the level 2 leave. SO, I went to extend my LOA two nights before it expired, and changed the return to work date to the new date (June 13th). That gives me time for my family member to come home and the week I'm to take care of them and ensure they can be left alone. As I went to do this, a day passed and suddenly I noticed I was on the schedule again. I'm assuming they just didn't see that I had extended this leave and I was reactivated. 

Do I simply call out again and use the COVID option until they realize this or should I enact an entirely new LOA? Sedgwick implied I would just extend the LOA but my store didn't catch it in time is my guess.",1.0,2,3

However, sometimes one member of the group will emerge as an unofficial leader and direct the group every night. I’m totally fine with being directed by someone else on the same pay grade as me, but lately my boundaries have started to be crossed.

One of our members who used to be part time has now moved to full time, and whenever she’s here she takes the leader role. I was fine with this for about a week, until she started acting disrespectful to me when we were resetting the TVs (She wanted to go off plan for no reason and did a bad job explaining how to do it, wouldn’t listen to me, and stormed off saying “forget it it’s all going over your head” in a rude way when I said her plan didn’t make sense)

Since then I’ve been noticing her disrespect more in how she is often bossy and in our business when we’re perfectly capable of working on our own. She seems particularly mad when she’s got her own plan or understanding of how to do something beyond the norm, doesn’t tell me how it deviates from the norm, and then I do it the normal way and now it’s messed her up.

walmart,1622721578,nrbql6,My poor advice,"Around the end of February I began to work at Walmart. I’ve been there about a month and a half now. I work in cap 2 by the way. So for the first month I’d say I actually cared about doing my job correctly and I would still get my stuff done on time, but it would take longer. So I start getting out on my own every single day because they know I’ll get it done no matter what. So I start not caring. They don’t come to check on me and I don’t want to kill myself doing extra work. So I start putting things where they don’t belong and throwing overstock onto the top stock. They are none the wiser. Actually tell me I am one of the best stockers there. So then by about 2 months I decide I really don’t care but I’m gonna help my coworkers out. I tell them to do the same stuff I do. Stuff starts getting done faster but every once in a while I hear a “damn it who put that there” from a manager. Now most of the people I do work with don’t care either and out things in random spots if they don’t know where they go. They throw overstock on the top stock in the box and in the wrong spots. A couple people even took my patented technique of making things disappear by just lobbing them anywhere they want. So in conclusion I have turned about 7 or 8 people into worse versions of myself and it brings a smile to my face when I see a bunch of stuff in the wrong spot.",1.0,1,31

(Canada)","I placed an order over a week ago, which showed up as ""available"" on my local store. But for whatever reason, it decided that the order has to be shipped from another store.

No word about the order for a week. No emails. I check tracking and see that it ""arrived"" 3 days ago. No further updates, and if I look up tracking on Loomis Express it just says delivered. The issue being it's not at the right store.

Double checked to make sure my order was set to the correct store: And both on the website and on Loomis Express it says the ""Destination"" is my city (Langley BC), however on tracking it says ""Delivered"" to Burnaby BC

I call the help center, talk to them about the order, how it's not at the right store. They put me on hold for a few moments while checking on it. They said there's a bug on the website, and on Loomis Express it says it delivered to the correct website (Which makes no sense since on my end it doesn't say that. I hope she didn't just look at the ""destination"" instead of where it actually is). They told me to contact my local store for pickup, and that it was delivered to that store 3 days ago.

Contact the local store. I tell them that I just contacted the Help Center, and they told me to contact the store to ask about my pickup. The associate says he's busy at the moment, and will call me back in half an hour. He also asked if this was the number they told me to call: And to that the answer is No. No as in they didn't give me any number to contact, so I just looked up ""Langley Walmart Pickup Center"" on google and contacted that.

3 hours later, no phone call. 

So lost as to where my order actually is, who to contact, and how I don't make myself sound like an ass when I go to the store (because from the posts here, a lot of you guys get annoyed af when someone comes to the store and they hadn't received a pickup email).

walmart,1622674021,nqyl03,I don't know what to do (incoming rant warning),"My last day was back on the 14th of May. I took the time to type up a proper and professional 2 weeks notice to give my ASM, and I printed three copies of it. One for the ASM, one for the SM or personnel manager, and one for my own records. I went in on April 30th with two copies on me. I presented them to my Cap2 ASM and informed her, verbally, of my intentions to resign effective May 14th, and expressed that I would like to return, if allowed, for seasonal work in the winter months for Holiday rush. She flat out told me that Walmart does not accept written notices, and that a verbal communication to her would be enough. I kinda scratched my head, and said okay, but I didn't feel good about it, and she told me NOT to give the letter to the SM or PL, because she would ""handle it"", and she would have me put on ""inactive status"" to avoid going back through orientation and CBLs and blah blah blah. I didn't feel good about it, but I took her for her word because... well... she's my ASM, so why the fuck should I question her, right? Just run along, little peon, and do your job, right? Well, I instantly noticed that I was being added to the stores schedule for dates beyond my final day, as I had communicated to the ASM who said she was going to ""handle it"". I approached her about the scheduling, and she said ""yeah don't worry about that, we'll fix it after your last day."" Again, I felt pretty weird about it, but... ASM word is bond, right? Unbeknownst to me, this same ASM was under investigation for policy violations, and a few other things. Long story short, she got fired on May 13th. The day before my final day.

Fast forward a bit after my last day... I decide to pull up my app to try and use the ask Sam feature, and I find out I have a total of 10.5 occurrences for no call no shows. I took a screenshot and texted it to one of my former coworkers to ask if he knew if anything was said by our TLs. No one knew anything about the occurances, and EVERYONE knew that my intended last day was the 14th. INCLUDING TLs, and other ASMs that I had pretty regular interactions with. TL;DR the fired ASM apparently NEVER informed the SM or PL about my two weeks notice, and completely fucked me over intentionally... because she's a total piece of shit, and I guess that was just one of many reasons she was being investigated. So, I went up to the store to see if I couldn't get some answers, and my TL on duty was really sympathetic and told me how sorry he was, and that him and the other TL had tried to go to bat for me with the PL and explain the situation, but because the PL never got the written notice, and he was never informed, and that the ASM who was supposed to inform him was no longer able to confirm my story, I am basically shit outta luck for future employment for a period of 6 months from the point of my termination, at which point IF I am rehired for seasonal employment, I have to go through a totally new rehire process.

Personally, I feel like I was a deliberate set-up for termination by the asshole ASM. Now, I can live without Walmart just fine, that's not the problem. I mean, my job now (albeit seasonal 9 months) earns me almost 4 times the money that Walmart does, so I'll be just fine. My irritation comes from the fact that I seriously developed friendships with people and enjoyed going in to spend time with them while we worked together. It was fun, despite the bullshit that looms over the corporate umbrella of Walmart. 

So, on a timeline scale, the 6 month period is up towards the end of November so I guess I can possibly still squeeze in if they'll hire me for seasonal since I obviously have past experience, but it's the whole ordeal that really pisses me off. And to be told nothing can be done makes it even more aggravating, considering everyone else knew my intentions, and can confirm them to the SM and PL. But THAT'S not good enough, I guess. It's terribly unfortunate, but in my opinion, for Walmart, not me. I want to say I'm over it, and I'll deal with it if I choose to go back, but I'm wondering if there is anyone above the store level I can talk to for pleading my case. Considering the ASM was fired for policy violations and more, it should be at least worth it to listen to my story and consider the circumstances.",1.0,1,7

walmart,1622672385,nqy0je,Anyone else's stores seeing heavy attrition and turnover in hourly leadership positions since GWP/Teaming?,"I'm mainly asking about Neighborhood Markets, but I would also like to hear about Super Centers and Sam's Clubs for y'all out there too.

Ever since our store went live into Great Work Place/Teaming or whatever the fuck they're calling it now, a year ago...we've seen not only ridiculous, but curiously heavy turnover in Team Leads and Academy Trainer positions across the store. I understand that Academy Trainers are not technically ""supervisors"" in the regard to they cannot hold associates accountable and have no direct reports; however they still receive and occasionally fulfill the role of MoD or Manager On Duty, and my store's salaried management abused them by treating them as overworked and underpaid department managers.

I work at an Neighborhood Market so we still have Academy Trainer's; but I've heard that Super Centers are down to just Team Leads for hourly leadership, now.

Anyway, the math breaks down like this: we essentially have five teams - ODP (Online Delivery Pickup), Front End, Fresh, Food and Consumables, and Sales Floor (3pm-12am). ODP and FE were both under the same Team Lead when we first rolled out, so ODP had one AT and FE had two AT's; however they recently split up and created a new FE Team Lead position and a third FE Academy Trainer, while eliminating the ODP Academy Trainer Position. I have been told that Super Centers divide the fresh areas into two Teams, with two separate Team Leads: Deli/Bakery and Meat/Produce; however Neighborhood Markets only have one Fresh Team lead with an Academy Trainer in each area.

The main course and why you're still here...In just a year since going live we are now currently:
Online Delivery Pickup Team Lead: we are on our first TL.
Online Delivery Pickup Academy Trainer: no longer exists.
Front End Team Lead: we are on our third TL.
Fresh Team Lead: we are on our fourth TL.
Meat/Produce Academy Trainer: we are on our fifth AT.
Deli/Bakery Academy Trainer: we are on our sixth AT.
Food and Consumables Team Lead: we are still on our first TL.

walmart,1622588651,nq7782,Probably a dumb question but...who closes your store?,"I'm a closing APCH, my schedule ends at 11pm when our store closes.  However we still have customers in the store because the manager is so afraid to lose a sale that he will allow people to enter even at 10:59pm.  

I've tried asking different managers and of course I get different answers.  Our front end team lead says we can turn off the door at 10:55pm and we do not have to stay and wait for the last customer to leave.  Another manager says we do have to wait for the last customer to leave, even though our shift ends at 11pm.   Overnight manager says we cannot leave until the front door is secure and locked (however we do not have keys, all we can do is turn the door switch off so it won't automatically open).

For a few months, I was nice and I stayed until the last customer left...then they started cutting my hours because I had over time.  Nobody ever came by to watch the door, turn it off, or lock it.  Since I can't afford to have my hours cut because someone is not doing their job, I started leaving at 11pm.  They've started sendng a cashier to the door but on her days off, there is nobody who comes to watch the door for the last customers.  Last night was one of those nights and I left at the end of my shift.  Now I've been hearing a rumor that I'm getting coached for leaving the door unsecured (today is my day off---if I do get coached I will refuse to sign).

(I know it can’t be weekend days) I’m only actually not available on Wednesdays as of right now, but I’ll be starting school in August and a dedicated two days for schoolwork (I’d take online classes) plus Wednesdays would be preferred. I figured if I had 3 days where I wasn’t available that would also make it unlikely I’d be scheduled over 32 hours as well.

walmart,1622583443,nq5bzr,Scalpers ruined my experience.,"recently just got back into collecting pokemon cards and I was actually super excited to get back into the hunt.. It's been a really really rough year for me with back to back issues, so it felt good to feel some sort of happiness or to finally look forward to do something for once.

 Sadly that didnt last very long.

Now look, i haven't bought pokemon cards since 2006 waaaaaay back in my native country of Venezuela and i'm saying this because the process of buying over there is WAAAAAAY different  (Also i was like 7 so it really wasnt me buying them haha)

Anyways, I go to walmart (8520 N Beach St, fort worth)and i genuinely don't have a single. fucking clue. where these cards would be, so out of instinct i went to the toy section and of course NOTHING. Puzzle section. NOTHING. Book section. NOTHING. Electronic/collectables. NOTHING.

So after looking like a weirdo for an hour..a whole 20 year old in the toy section of Walmart... i kindly asked a nearby worker ""where would the pokemon cards be located if you had any available?"" she didn't know, which was fine because i didn't know either so who am I to say anything😂 but she kindly directed me towards ""the guy that handles all of that stuff"" so i went over and asked the same question showing him a picture for reference... And god damn i might as well have said ""hey fuck you you piece of shit where the Pokemons at"" because without hesitation in this extremely shitty, loud, aggressive tone the dude says  "" I CANT HELP YOU WIT THAT, I CANT REALLY TELL YOU WHETHER WE HAVE ANY IN STOCK OR NOT YOUR GONNA HAVE TO DO WIT WHAT WE HAVE"" 
(Loud, waving his arms everywhere)

So now he got me sitting here confused as to #1 why the fuck he's talking to me in that matter and #2 why he even brought inventory up..  Mr.big nuts over here literally over threw my whole question with whatever the fuck he was babbling about.. so again i ask ""where would they be located if you had any Pokemon cards?"" 

He replies with ""in the front""(not even an isle #) at this point. Fuck you. i walk away.. and as I'm walking away i hear him call the coworker i originally talked to saying ""these kids will take all the inventory and leave nothing behind for anyone that's why you can't tell them of we have anything"" (LOUD)

Like what in the fuck just happened?? 

Yes. I GET IT. People are shitty. people will take all the inventory and leave nothing for anyone like assholes, BUT who the FUCK do you think you are putting me in that category without knowing my intentions??? Specially as I'm politely asking you where an item is LOCATED.
 I'm not asking you about ur fucking inventory you piece of shit.

Took me a while, but i ended up finding the special bullshit isle where they were supposed to be and surprise, surprise. Nothing.

This was such a shitty and toxic experience... Ya boy was simply trying buy packs locally and i get shit on.

 I got hella pride, but even without pride no one wants to be accused of being a greedy scum bag.

Customer service called down for an OGP Team Lead to deal with a customer complaint but the TL was busy at the time so i offered myself to listen to the customer and see if there was anything I could do to help him while he waited on our TL. He explained (very angrily may I add) that his order was delivered to his house and left outside in the rain. All his groceries were soaked. I apologized for the inconvenience and at this point my TL showed up, (mind you he just got promoted to OGP TL and has no idea WTH he’s doing) i stepped away for a moment and when I returned the customer somehow was even more pissed and giving my TL major attitude. My TL asked me if I could look up this guys order and I said “of course” so I turned to the customer and asked him if he could pull up his order number for me. He gets really dramatic and smacks his lips like it’s such an inconvenience for him to do this but ultimately pulls it up. He flips his phone screen over to me to where I see his order number for a brief second before his finger touches something and accidentally his screen tab switches over to some  PORN video he’d been watching. I have NO idea how I managed to keep a straight face and simply tell the customer “could you go back the order number please? Your screen switched.” 
The way his eyes bugged out after he saw his screen will be engraved in my mind lol.

The game case did not have a disk inside, so I went back with the receipt and asked the same  employee who checked me out what happened. He told me to check out with customer service. So I waited about 20-25 minutes in line waiting to speak and the guy who worked as an employee argued the box was open thus they will not accept refunds, which I told him I simply wanted the game I paid for and am fully aware of their return policy, but this is their mistake. 

He brings in the manager, who was raising her voice and I was just nervous as hell. I did not yell back or make a scene, I wanted them to help me but they give me the typical ""We don't accept once it's opened"" line, and then I think she got upset when I busted her lying about some federal law doesn't allow Walmart to return used games. That's not even why I came here, I was looking for the item I had paid for, not to return it because she didn't seem intelligent to know that.

An intellectual property lawyer told me there is no federal law that actually exists, Walmart and other retailers use that lie (""Federal law does not allow us to return unopened games due to copyright laws"") to trick customers into not accepting refunds.

I have to leave for a doctor's appointment in the middle of my shift right around when I would take my lunch break. I'm able to work after the appointment is over and it shouldn't be much longer than an hr altogether. Anyways, my HR rep told me I should clock out for lunch to go to the appointment and then eat lunch afterwards and take an extra long lunch basically. Then, this is where I got confused, she wants me to clock back in and then enter ppto in for the extra time I spent out during lunch. My confusion is, say I clock out for lunch at 3:30 and clock back in at 5:00, do I keep the time clock the way it is saying that I got back at 5 and then just enter ppto for the 30min extra or do I enter a time clock adjustment to change my meal end to 4:30 and enter in the 30 min ppto?

Put simply, the team lead on the front end is making us responsible for our registers in electronics. Which is fine! The issue comes in, that I work alone quite often and doing so leaves the department empty.

We've already had a very large supply of expensive headphones stolen from a case at the end of the last year, specifically because this same team lead made another associate leave the department empty to drop tils. Which lead us to adopt the practice of not leaving the department empty. It's been so long at this point, we've all accepted it as policy. And to be honest I don't know if it is isn't. But with holiday coming up, I'd say it's more important now than ever.

I remembered when I was hired I was told, if you called off on a blackout date, it's double points. I was also told you would need double the ppto to cover the 2 points.

So if you called off on an 8 hour shift, you'd need 16 hours of ppto to cover that one call off

I dont know of that was true back the past, I know when I was absent for a blackout date maybe a year or so ago, I used 8 hours of ppto and it covered both points of that single call off.

I just heard from a semi reliable source that walmart is changing its policy, and now you will have to use double PPTO to cover double points. Anyone else hear anything?",1.0,1,12

Now we both work in apparel and he has never did anything wrong, our team leads loved him, his section was always neat and finished his work ahead of time. Today we were scheduled 7am-12pm. A light shift. Our team lead decided to let us take 1 hour lunches since our sections were finished and nothing else really to do but continue zoning. Lunch was 9am-10am. We got off a lunch and went back the floor. We hadn't taken our 15 so we decided to ask our team lead when we could. She said to take it at 11am. So we did. During our 15 minute break, another manager confronted my buddy and accused him of taking long lunches because she had just saw him in the breakroom at 10am, and now she saw him again at 11am. After explaining that twice, she insisted that he was taking longer than expected lunches, and refused to speak to our team lead. She went and got the store manager involved (who had already was in a bad mood), and the SM immediately took the other managers side. (Guessing she was a Store lead or Coach, her badge was backwards.) So after the accusations were thrown, the SM asked for his vest and badge and sent him home and said he was terminated, with a nasty tone. He is also a minor, and had no ride home.

So the other cashier was checking them out and they recommended a big cooler and they wanted it. Problem is we actually had ran out of the big ones and only had small ones. So again, we were packed and I was getting pretty overwhelmed. So they came back and were like you guys are out of the big ones, I need a refund. The other cashier asked me to handle the return, and I was still with another customer so I said right after. So the guy was like can I just get the small cooler and grab a cheap gum. I said yes that would be fine but before I was able to ask for the receipt so I can handle the retur, they had already walked out (they said they were in a rush).

i went and told 3 different team leads. all of them either told me “we’ll talk about it later” and then left before we could. apparently the only two people in the store that can fix it is on vacation, and the other one my schedule doesn’t line up with hers (i pretty much only work weekends, she doesn’t work weekends)

i asked again today, one of them wrote it down in a notebook to remind herself. i asked again later if that meant i was good for friday, and was told to call the store monday to try and talk to people lead (she’s 100% there). problem is no one answers the phone at my walmart.

i work sunday, and then i don’t work again until that friday i need off. should i try calling the store, or should i just come in to get it sorted? i have a letter from the school even stating i need this day off. 

any help is appreciated. i like the pay here for being a student, and id rather not lose the job.",1.0,1,3

walmart,1622264107,nnfw7y,"Dear Management, If a system works, leave it alone. If it doesn't, don't go overboard and screw everyone else and yourself over to ""fix"" it.","Background: I'm on Cap2; I mainly work in cosmetics. On 10+ hr freight days, they pair someone with me so that we can get it all done. It's been like this for the past few months since I let management know that I'm pregnant (6mo along as of now). Priority is hair products before cosmetic products. No complaints from management until a week ago.

Had 14.5-15hrs of freight. We decided to do box freight (which is mostly hair products) &gt; totes (which is usually roughly half hair products, half cosmetics) &gt; pick n packs (usually cosmetics but sometimes hair products; this particular day was all cosmetics), so we worked box freight, worked totes, and left the pick n packs for last in case we didn't have time to get to then. We would both go back at the same time; one deals with cardboard and the other grabs the next bunch of freight.

SM sees us walking back together and complains to our supervisor who in turn tells my partner to work pharmacy instead (presumably to keep it from happening again). Never tells me so I end up finding out on my own from my partner. Pass him several times after and never mentioned anything about it to me.

I don't get paired with anyone on the days following, despite several 10+ hr days. Needless to say, I never manage to get done on a single one of them.

Yesterday, I had 10hrs and a girl working D17 had 2hrs. She decided to come help me each time her cart was done because her freight was slow while mine was building on me with each time I went back. We would finish my cart and both head back to check our own freight. Most of the day passes like this until the last hour, when the SM passed us on our way to the back.

Again, same complaints from the SM and our supervisor tells us off. Managed to get all our freight done anyway.

Today, one truck with 14hrs of freight and by myself... Again... I don't know why I try. I'm just doing the 7 or so hrs that I can and going home for my weekend (it's my Friday). If they wanna go overboard on punishing us for working what we thought was efficiently (and not even trying to correct us by letting us know and giving us a chance to correct it) just because we were ""walking to the back together and leaving unworked freight out"", then they get to deal with the aftermath of me not being able to get my freight done due to putting me by myself on 10+ hr freight days. We weren't screwing around or intentionally wasting time; we were splitting up and working on freight we designated for each other, and doing the same when we'd get to the backroom. I'm sick of not being heard when I try to explain the situation and made out to be argumentative when I'm just trying to explain our side of it. I can only do so much on my own.

So I get off of my 6-3 shift tired as hell, but need to pick up some stuff. Note, the moment I clock out or go on break or anything, my vest comes off, when I clock out, I wrap it around my neck like a scarf. Normally I try to just carry whatever I need but after picking up bleach, tortillas, and bread and still needing to get more stuff, I decided to set my stuff down and grab a cart. 

I walk over to the front of the store grocery side, and to my surprise there’s no one in the opening but me and two carts. I start to grab one to find they are stuck, I work at them for a good 30 seconds and finally pry them loose. I hand the first one to someone who came in right as I started working on it and started to go on my way. Suddenly, I hear a loud obnoxious voice behind me. 

 “IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT CART?!?!?!?” 

I turn around and look to see some grouchy looking lady probably mid 50s staring at me. I look at her and say “oh no, I’m using it” 

“OH! I’m sorry! I THOUGHT YOU WORKED HERE!!!” Yelled the grumpy troll

“I do, but I’m allowed to shop here too” I say to her

From this point she goes ballistic. She starts screaming and swearing, yelling “what the fuck” over and over, telling me I’m incredibly rude. Eventually her daughter comes over (whom was outside) and starts yelling at me while not knowing what’s going on. Then her son in law (I didn’t know at the time) whom is probably 6ft 250 lbs tried challenging me and yelling at me to take this outside with him (I’m 5’8” 135 lbs) I sarcastically called him incredibly brave to wanna fight me. I start to just walk away and she starts yelling at me telling me she’s gonna report me to the management here. 

“WHATS YOUR NAME AND YOUR BADGE NUMBER?!?!?” 

I looked at her confused and said “Lady I don’t gotta give you shit!” And went on my way. But it don’t stop there.

So I go on and continue my shopping and eventually go down by the freezer bunkers where I see big strong boy leaning against the bunkers. I look at him and raise my eyebrows out of jest. And then turn down the aisle I needed to. At this point Big strong boy started walking towards me and started saying “you want this! You don’t want this! I’ll fuck you up” 

I tell him “next time just mind your own business homes”(note I didn’t know the relation between the 3 at that point) 

At this point he starts lightly walking towards me and his wife(?) starts “holding him back” and she yells at me saying that “You should just walk away” and “you don’t want this” over and over. 

Eventually the grumpy troll magically appeared out of no where! And she starts yelling at me again how they’ve already reported me and they are getting my ass fired. So I should just walk away. 

“You guys literally just followed me over here.” 

“WE WERENT FUCKING FOLLOWING YOU”

“You were over there 👉🏻, I walked over here, now you’re over here. That’s the definition of following” 

“WE WERENT FUCKING FOLLOWING YOU”

“Why are you yelling right now?”

“Because I’m mad 😡! I yell when I’m angry 😤!” The grumpy troll puffed out!

At this point I notice my manager walk up behind them just watching the whole thing, none of them notice of course cause they are busy yelling at me. 

“Why are you mad? I grabbed a cart”

“IM THE CUSTOMER GOD DAMN IT!!! YOU NEED TO TREAT ME AND EVERYONE ELSE BETTER!” 

“I’m a customer too I-“

“YOU WORK HERE! I DESERVE WHATEVER I WANT” the grumpy troll roared!

“I don’t work here right now” I then notice my manager waving me to just walk away.

“I wish I knew...” I then explained what happened, and he just looked at me and shrugged his shoulders. I ask if I’m good, and he said I can do whatever I need and go home. I asked him about it since, he said I was fine and they walked in the store that day and chose violence.

Costco,1623425740,nxitqx,Nightmare of a delivery experience,"Ya'll I'm at my wits' end here.

I get a discount through work on appliances through LG. And they use costco logistics (innovel solutions) to deliver. I placed my first order for a refrigerator early april, item is scheduled for delivery beginning of May. They call and tell me it's raining so they can't deliver and will reschedule. I'm like whatever, fine. 

They delivered the item in a coupled of days, installed it and walked out before I got a chance to inspect it, it had a dent in the front, so i had to get them to to come pick it up for return the next day and I placed a 2nd order. It took a couple weeks for it to reach the warehouse and I finally got to schedule it for this monday. The 2 hour window  comes and goes, nothing from the delivery people yet, i called their support and the lady said she has no idea why but it was rescheduled to wednesday but it was on the truck for delivery and they didn't finish the route for some reason and thats why it got rescheduled, i'm like WTF nobody told me and I had to take the day off for this to stay home. She was like im sorry etc etc for your trouble and said it would be delivered on Wednesday. Tuesday evening i was supposed to get a call with my 2 hour delivery window - that didn't happen, I called support and they were closed. So I call first thing wednesday morning and the agent says he has NEVER seen this happen before but one system says it was scheduled and another didn't so it didn't actually get scheduled for delivery and he scheduled it for friday. So that's 2 days off wasted. And now it's friday, and i get a call from the warehouse saying they don't have the right item?! I'm LIVID. How was it on the vehicle for delivery on Monday if they never had the right item in the first place ? He said he has no idea how this was missed and will talk to the origin warehouse and see whats happening.

This is so fucking ridiculous. And costco support can't even help me with some kind of refund for all the trouble because my order is through LG. And LG doesn't have a support number for me to call through because it's a b2b partner website and my emails go unanswered for days -\_- I'm frustrated with both costco and LG. 1 month in the new house without a refrigerator.",1.0,1,25

I have been working at Costco for almost a year now (10 months) and have been greatly enjoying my job, even if it has been part-time. 


I’m looking into putting in my two-weeks notice however, as I am getting interested in a different job that may have room for growth in a field I am interested in. 


What I want to know is if I decide to put my two weeks notice in, when is a good day to put it in and who do I give it to?


If it helps to know, I have a very good relationship with all my managers/supervisors. I’ve done my best to work my butt off working in the front end and have even helped a tiny bit with morning merch (enough to be offered a position). I think I may have one tardy, but as far as I know I have no write ups or counseling notices.

I'm slightly freaking out. This is so much. We're going to be a lot more broke than we thought. With work getting slowed so darn much from COVID to the chip shortage we're going to have damn near nothing in our savings when we move in.

So the home we rent now is a 3 bedroom 1 bath at 925 sqft. The home we're having built is 2227 sqft. We don't even come close to having things to put in it. 

We have two young boys. We are good on their stuff. We need a bedroom set. Also the sofa we have now is beyond dead and the only reason we haven't gotten rid of it is because we need to save as much as we can to throw at the downpayment, closing costs, ect. 

So we have a living room set on order at a furniture store here in town. It's 3 pieces, two sofas and a char. We put down $600. I think the set was slightly over $2600. We're going to have to cancel that now and we'll lose $100 in breaking the agreement but we can't do that now. We'll be $3k off what we thought we would have. And that's the best case right there.

But our credit card is empty and we always report a zero balance. We only use it for things we are already going to buy just for the rewards and pay it monthly. So when we get in we can get our bedroom set and then pay it off and get a living room set.

I'm also going to need to do a washer and dryer and wonder if they will deliver it upstairs where the laundry room will be. 

Idk I made this post because I'm just freaking out and this sub is really great and helpful. And I'm sure some of you understand the position I'm in and I'm hoping to get some good insight into something I may have overlooked.

I had no idea I'd wind up at a Costco at 5pm on a Sunday evening as they were closing the Tire Center.

Rami, who might be a supervisor, looked for appropriate tires and showed them to me. Then he said he'd try to get approval to mount them after hours. Well time dragged on as my son and I had difficulties finding a way to pay for the tires. **Nota Bene!** Costco  does NOT accept Master Card debit or credit cards! That was all we had between us, a couple each but all Master Cards. Also, the ATM inside the store, which Rami got us access to, doesn't work with Master Card debit cards, my son was unable to get cash. Strangely, when I later tried with my European debit card (Master Card), I was able to get cash.

So the tires were paid for and a very (extremely) patient Rami and his associate, whose name I unfortunately did not get, mounted and balanced the tires and all work was finished pretty close to 6pm. Amazing!

Of course I tried to give them a tip but they refused saying something about a fine (or did he say fired?) if they accepted. He asked me to leave a nice review instead - no problem!

I recently received an email from Costco requesting feedback from my experience. I want to make sure my experience does not just stay in a survey so I am writing here some of what I wrote on the survey. This has been the worst experience I've ever had with any retailer in my life.  From the long wait, the lack of truthfulness from Costco representatives and the delivery team. 

When I initially received the W/D the stacking kit was missing. It was my fault because I was not aware I needed one since my previous W/D did not require one. The delivery team contacted the Costco rep to notify the stacking kit was missing. I was advised by the Costco rep over the phone that I should order one through Costco Online or Amazon and as soon as I receive it to notify them in order to send the delivery team for installation. I immediately logged in to Costco Online just to find out that the item was not sold separately. I decided to chat with the rep who told me to order to item from amazon and then call back. I asked her if she could wait a minute as I was placing the order at the same time we were chatting. I purchased the item and advise her. She reached out to Costco Logistics to schedule the appointment. It turned out that the Costco Logistics team stated that I would lose any warranty because the stacking kit was not purchased from Costco and the Delivery Team will not install anything that what's on the box they deliver. The Costco rep stated that my only option was to cancel my order and purchase a new W and D with the stacking kit. By them, the Delivery team had already left my house with my old washer and dryer and the new ones left in my garage. I advised the Costco rep the delivery team was gone to which she replied that they will not turn around because I accepted the delivery.

So at that moment, I found myself with no washer and dryer so I placed a new order for which I had to wait almost two months and about the same time for them to pick up the new ones left in my garage. Yes, they could not use the new ones sitting in my garage. I had to get new ones.

Once I received the new ones, the Delivery Team told me that the W and D will not fit in my laundry room. Yes, this was after I was the previous team had installed the washer from the first delivery. After going back and forth with the now disgruntled and repulsive delivery guy who even told me that he would install them but if they did not fit he was not going to take them back. Once upstairs he refused to place the W and D on top of a dripping pan to protect the home from water leaks.  At that time I was so fed up due to the entire situation that I decided it was not worth arguing with the guy. I can also continue ranting but for what.

* YES i always refrigerate it after opening it, immediately after stirring it
* IMO it's the best peanut butter out there, it's perfect
* HUGE peanut butter fan, eat it constantly
* I DID open another jar, just to check it it was that one, but same result :(
* Testing by other people has been inconclusive. I have at least 1 person saying it's all in my head, and another saying no, it does smell strange. 

I'm wondering if there was a bad batch? I have a third unopened jar that I'm willing to open, but I'm honestly afraid it will also smell/taste rancid. 

It's not un-eatable, but it does smell and taste different. I did catch COVID a while back (October) and have wondered if that affected my taste buds? But the timing is off, and no other foods have been affected.

The instructions warn you to drain the broth from the ""sous vide"" vegetables, and once you open the package and smell it, you understand why. Even with the broth drained, the cauliflower in the finished dish was plasticky or chemical in taste.

The 2 sauce bags contained the General Tso's sauce - okay in flavor but just a plain cornstarch-based sauce.

The guys ended up arriving at my house unannounced... I had a bad feeling about things once that happened.  Sure enough, the guys were really rough with the tv and packaging, opened the box and seemed surprised by how thin the tv was (as if they'd never installed a new tv before), dropped the tv out of the box and damaged the corner of the screen, and moved random stuff in my house that didn't need to be moved (I just don't like it when people touch stuff without asking beforehand, as I had cleared the entire living room beforehand to make enough room for them anyway).  Needless to say it was a really bad experience.

Thankfully though, when I called costco to describe the experience, the were very nice, refunded the install fee, and will be back next week to switch the tv out with another one.  I just hope it's not the same people again because that would be really awkward.

Long story short, This has been going on since early May where Costco logistics picked up the item and told me it will take 10 days for refund back to my CC (almost $1000). 

10 days passed and been calling every week for an update.  I even spoken to a supervisor last week and moved to escalation department but still no updates.  

Right now, I'm just hearing excuses and it takes time to process!?  My credit card won't assist until Costco exhaust all possible means.     

Is there a corporate PR or customer service number to call besides the Costco website?

3. Envy - Flavor is mild and sweet.  Not as crisp as I prefer.  This is a hybrid of a Royal Gala and a Braeburn which is super interesting because it's pretty different from the Kanzi.  Typically in stock at my Costco and a good back up.

Inconvenient, but not a huge deal. 
Now we have gotten a new puppy, plus still have the 2 small dogs and they have discontinued the puppy food we were using now too (yellow bag). This is so frustrating. It was basically the puppy version of the Red Bag food so it was going to be a seamless transition to the dog food that we're using for the other two, but now we had to switch to the nature's domain puppy food (teal bag) with completely different ingredients until the time that our four month old dog is able to move on to adult food with the other two.

Costco,1622998760,ntq7w1,Oversudsing with KS Ultra Clean Laundry Detergent,"The KS Ultra Clean liquid laundry detergent was on sale so I decided to give it a shot since it had pretty good reviews.  It was a pretty bad experience for me, but YMMV.  The scent is a little strong, but the real problem is how sudsy it is, especially since I have a front load HE washer.  The suds would build in volume and not rinse away easily, unlike most HE detergents.  I reduced the dosing every time to basically a teaspoon, would use an extra rinse, but it was still very sudsy and my towels were getting stiff.  I don't have soft water either (pretty medium, San Jose CA area).

&amp;#x200B;

Then I had 2 loads of laundry throw an error on my machine mid-wash.  I searched online and the error code means that the machine is overflowing with water (it wasn't) or there are so many suds that it's tripping the overflow sensor.  I did notice the pump seemed to be running excessively long when initiating a spin cycle.  I re-washed that load with just water, and a lot of soap came out.  Then I ran the machine clean cycle and the amount of detergent build up after \~1 month of use was incredibly bad.  I knew the detergent had to go back.  Thankfully, Costco is great with returns, and I found my interaction with the CS rep interesting:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hi, I'd like to return this please.  It's way too sud...""

""Clogged up your machine?""

""Yup.  Clearly you must get this a lot?""

""All the time.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just wanted to pass along a warning of my experience with this product.  It seemed to clean well, but it started to damage my washing machine, and apparently I'm not alone.  I switched back to Tide (which was actually way cheaper on sale at Safeway than at Costco), and everything works perfectly again.  No more suds, build up, or error codes, and my towels are softer and fluffier again.",1.0,1,14
Costco,1622994220,ntoknq,2-day shipping: isn't,"I was extremely happy when the Costco website introduced the 2-day shipping and 1-day shipping features. The nearest Costco is a little bit of a drive away and I can't always make it. So the new shipping options would help me order cheese, meat and snacks right to my door. Or so I thought. 

I have previously ordered using 2-day shipping, where one of my items was delivered (I kid you not) after two weeks. No harm, no foul, things happen. The other stuff that was supposed to be delivered in 2 days wasn't delivered in 2 days either. You know, not a problem… it was a new feature then. 

But I recently ordered with 2-day shipping again, and it's been 2 days yesterday, and the order status still shows ""order is being prepared"". I have a feeling it won't be getting delivered before mid-week next week. 

Contrast that with the experience we have all had with Amazon. When they say ""two day delivery""… they mean two day delivery. 

As retail industry has moved on and evolved, I am fearful that Costco will be left behind. I love the company and what it stands for. I love that they treat their employees much better. I was hoping Costco will set yet another standard in home delivery logistics while maintaining their reputation for treating their employees well. 

I am willing to forgive Costco a lot of things just because I'm not donating to the Bezos Empire every time I need something delivered to my house. Because this current order was delayed, won't mean I will die. But I do want the best for Costco, and I am afraid that most customers just want delivery to be held to the Amazon standard. 

To be relevant in twenty years from now, Costco has to step up its home delivery game by a big, big, big margin. 

This is somewhat of a longer post. I hope it doesn't come across as a rant. I'll continue to shop at Costco as long as I can.",0.99,1,198

The latter seems like the best deal to me. The storage size (64GB vs 128GB) is a dealbreaker, which makes the Pro the best option here. By comparing the prices with Apple’s website, the Air is already listed at $30 less so I’m assuming the Pro has a price reduction too.

Costco,1622820921,ns7zcj,Supply Chain Economics,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img fssmp197q9371...*

Last week I purchased these Melona frozen bars. Price approximately $0.35/each in box of 24. They tasted OK. I looked at ingredients and discovered they were made in Korea.

That made me think about what seemed to me impossible supply chain economics.

Made/frozen/packaged in Korea then shipped to my west coast Costco. 

1. Freezer truck to airport or shipping port in Korea.

2. Frozen shipping on plane or ship. 

3. Freezer truck from US port/airport to Costco. Customs fees etc.

4. Unpacking and stocking in Store. 

5. Cost of maintaining frozen until sold.

How is this even possible at this price? Are there freezer containers on ships? Are bulk air freight for frozen goods that low?

Probably not the correct reddit to ask this question but maybe someone here has an insight how this might work. If these were made in SF or LA I could understand the economics but Korea?",1.0,1,14

1) What typically does the AM stocking position do? I understand that they stock the store in the morning before opening but what specifically do they do. 

2) How physical/straining is the AM stocking position?

Costco,1622629834,nqipxw,Super afraid of having membership revoked due to 3 out of 4 portable ACs failing and needing to be returned,"I've had terrible luck.  I've purchased four portable ACs from Costco over the last nine years and three of them were defective, failing within 18 months, four months, and the new one I got last week had broken caster wheels and started leaking after only two days of operation.  

Despite this failure rate, I've told literally dozens of people that Costco is THE only option for buying a portable AC.  If you look at reviews on Costco and other sites, all portable ACs have like a 20-30% failure rate, and the manufacturers' warranties are worthless because you have to pay hundreds of dollars in round-trip shipping to utilize them.   The Costco return policy is your only protection against getting a $500-700 lemon.  I'm so passionate about protecting my friends and coworkers from this possibility that I've done everything except grab people by their lapels to get them to order through Costco rather than Amazon et al. 

Well, now I've received my third AC lemon in ten years and it has to be returned.  We're of course going to replace it with another Costco portable AC, but I am TERRIFIED that I might get my membership revoked for doing another ""big"" return.

I think I'm a good Costco member!  I have the Anywhere card and I bought my home and car insurance through Costco.  I use Costco Optical and Pharmacy.  I shop at Costco once a week for groceries and that's my only gas station.  

I do maybe two or three minor returns a year for issues like a foam pillow having a strong chemical odor or a clothing item not fitting.  Never anything stupidly abusive like returning a dead Christmas tree or a rotisserie chicken carcass or an 8 year old printer.  

But returning a third portable AC unit freaks me out!  Does this seem like too much? Should I preemptively talk to a supervisor or the store manager?  Does anyone have any insight into what might trigger Costco to cancel your membership?",1.0,1,18

Costco,1622606149,nqcr6q,I have worked at Costco for 15 years. I feel so depressed.,"I have been in almost all ancillary departments except, hearing aid, optical, photo, and tire center...  

My love is the deli, I started in the deli, and I wanted to move up, I was told it would be easy,  just work hard and learn as much as you can.

I learned meat department, food court, front end, member services, did S.I.T, went back to the deli, and I am a merchandiser.   I have always wanted to move up in the deli, for years I put in for supervisor spots, and was told, someone with more seniority, or knowledge, always got it, and I needed to know other areas of the warehouse.  Cool, I did that!

I tried again a few years later, was told I was was not knowledgeable enough with the AS400, and reports.  So I learned what I could access. 

Tried again. 
Was told I didn't know the Lingo enough.  Like the acronyms.   Okay. I went back to my manager and begged her to teach me. My department is one of the busiest in the region.  She refused  because we are too busy and she doesn't want to waste precious time outside of me and producing because I am one of her top producers.

She bullies and verbally tears down her crew of people and everyone is so used to the terrorizing ways we just take it and kept our heads down.  

Like I want to move up so fucking bad. Yet I have been told so much I am too nice, too talkative. Too friendly.  I have been told I will never move up over and over again by my old manager. 

I tried again recently,  I feel broken and so disheartening because even after 15 years of being a sponge, working my ass off, I am never good enough.  I know I am fat. I know I am not always the fastest. I get my job done.  What the fuck does it take to move up anymore.  It seems I must need to be a total brown noser or worse. I am not buddies or friends with managers,  nor do I want to be. I stay clear of being too friendly outside of work. I have seen some absolutely atrocious people be moved up who have no clue how to manage, have horrid communication skills. And yet they are all managers. 

Costco has broken me. I love and I hate Costco, but it's all I know, and I love working in the deli.  I want to be a deli manager some day but now I know.  I will never be anything but a grunt.

Costco has destroyed any self confidence I have had in the past. I have applied for over 13 years to probably 100 different supervisor spots. Nothing.  I came close once. I used to interview well, but my old manager did a number on my head, I stumble on my words and get so nervous now. Because I fear rejection, I know I am already rejected before I even try. They always have someone picked out anyways. Interviews are usually just formalities now days.  

I have been passed up for people I have so much more knowledge and experience on, and it will come to light they have family members that are managers in other stores,, its just so damn disheartening.   I don't know why I even try anymore.  Costco has destroyed my desire to be anything better because the rejection is destroying me.  Because they just want their good grunt workers to stay down so they can be pushed to the breaking point.  

I am so damn sad, angry at myself for wasting away my life and never getting farther. I wanted to grow with this company, I wanted to teach and help people grow. I wanted to be a deli manager. I am just the fat, annoying talkative person. I want to know what will make me good enough.  Will I ever be good enough? 
I have always been told I am a good teacher, patient, kind and very knowledgeable,  but its never enough!

YET, on the 21st I saw a large purchase that would have been sense using the Costco Citi promotion and applied for a card on Costco's website at the checkout screen. This is important. After being approved I realized I only received an email for the last 4 digits of the card. Couldn't sign up on Citi's website with that info, but amazingly if I wanted to renew my Costco card (that was due in a few days...) I could see the card's last 4 on Costco's website, so OBVIOUSLY there was some form of communication between Costco and Citi, even if I couldn't use the card to renew (or check out)

Called Costco that following Saturday after going into the store to inquire about how to pay for this large item. Got a temp card to renew my stuff, but the temp card doesn't work online. Gotta call Citi. Called Citi. Was told I have to wait for the physical card in the mail - no way to expedite. NO WAY TO EXPEDITE?!?!? So at this point I've likely pulled a hard credit to get a CC that I can't use. No virtual cards and no way for Citi to help me pay for what was on Costco's site.

Now, I almost focused my hate exclusively on Citi as they issued the card...BUT COSTCO ADVERTISES SIGNING UP FOR THE DAMN CARD WHEN CHECKING OUT!!!! Imagine if you were about to drop $4k on something on Amazon and they were like ""hey, sign up for our CC....thank you. You're approved! Now wait 7-10 business days for the actual card to come in the mail before purchasing. But don't worry, we'll send hourly reminders that you have items in your shopping cart!!!!!""

Last Weds I got a notice in the mail...that my card was on its way. Full of promotional crap that had no bearing on me. Naturally my large purchase went Out of Stock the day the promotion ended and now I have a CC that I couldn't use. I'll wait for a 4th of July sale or whatnot just so I can exercise the warranty feature, but if that wasn't the case I'd use my Discover card, get that 5% back for warehouse purchases online, and dip. 

Costco: You shouldn't try to pimp a card at the checkout screen if folks can't use it ASAP. Citi, you shouldn't act like you can't expedite a card for first-time issues. If it was a replacement I could have allegedly had it FedEx, which blew my mind. Furthermore I read on a forum that if you claimed you were doing international travel that may trigger the release; I shouldn't have to lie to get a card to use!

Costco makes almost all profits on membership dues.  Sales minus costs and admin (salaries) wipes out all sales essentially.  

Membership renewal rate is almost 90%, very strong

Same store sales have continued to grow, at 16% increase

TIL Costco has their own chicken farm and two beef farms to supply their meat products

Costco opened their first store in China last year.  While they have stores in Taiwan, Korea and Japan already.

This first store in China is their largest and after one year produced 400,000 memberships!  It's in Shanghai, one of the largest cities but still! 

They have 2 more Chinese stores under construction in China.

I watched a video of the CEO walking through the store showcasing how great the low prices were.  The host asked if they could make more by raising the prices and the CEO laughed so hard!  ""That's not us!""

Costco's Mission:

""Here at Costco, we have a very straightforward, but important mission: to continually provide our members with quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices.""

Costco stock pays a dividend, but occasionally they will pay an extra dividend to reward investors!  Yes, their great service extends to shareholders too!

Memorial Day means we are closed Monday and we all get holiday pay. The schedule for Memorial Day week was posted, and I had my regular weekday off in addition to the holiday and Saturday—so three days off this week for the holiday. 

But on the original schedule, those employees who usually had Monday or Tuesday off lost their third day off for the week. They only had Monday and Saturday. This upset them, so a few complained to the manager. She told them they were causing trouble for the business. Then, this Wednesday, she redid the schedule for next week and took away the weekday off for every single part time employee.

However, since the nearest Costco is a minimum of 2 hours away (possibly less transfers?) and I would be coming in pre-trained, I was feeling pretty hopeful when I applied.

I am curious to know when to expect a response from them- will they contact me even if they’re rejecting my application? I also asked that they not contact my current employer because I haven’t told my employer I’m applying for a new job- will that hurt me since I asked them not to contact the only place where I have optical experience?

Any suggestions on waiting for this ""100$ sale"" which happens at certain times, or buy and request a ""Price Adjustment"", if it kicks in? (note: price adjustment happens within 30 days according to their site). 

A +100$ is sort of a deal-breaker to my head and I ""could"" buy another gift  :shrug:

Costco,1622221403,nn2e37,"I hate this job, just want to transfer but can’t. Help.","I’ve worked at costco for two years. I hate every waking second of it. The complete lack of training, braindead management, rampant nepotism, sexual harassment, revolving door of employees, and fickle safety procedures are just a few of my concerns. Our warehouse manager asking Covid-positive employees who didnt show symptoms to still work their shifts is yet another concern.
Being screwed out of my Covid bonus as a part timer who works full time hours is, again, yet another concern.

When I started, I really gave it my all, but it slowly faded, starting with when they promoted a man in the warehouse who was well known to sexually harass every female coworker in the store, all because he was cozy with management, not because he was even remotely close to fulfilling his job description.

The only reason I’ve stayed at all is to transfer out of state then immediately look for something else after moving. I’ve been sending out transfer requests and job bank applications left and right since the start of this year, and can’t seem to secure anything or get any opportunity to leave my warehouse. I’ve put in for almost 40 jobs, interviewed for about half of those applications. Nothing.

Look, I’m remaining cautiously hopeful that this is just my current store, not the company as a whole. I would love to transfer to see if an older more established warehouse has it’s shit at least somewhat together. But what now? I’m in great standing, near perfect attendance, perfect reviews, and even letters of recommendation, but I get nothing but transfer denials, rejection letters, or just complete radio silence on any job transfer I apply to.

Is it even worth trying to transfer with this company? Because my mental health means much more to me than Jelinek’s stock going up a quarter of a percent.

I have always told people they should buy TVs from Costco because they are a no hassle return/repair/replace store. I said this having never returned anything before. I used the concierge system once and was directed how to reset my TV which solved my issue back then. Last year I bought a TCL 50"" from Costco, and it worked great. Thirteen months later, the TV failed by displaying only vertical purple and black bars. I have gone through at least 7 - 10 calls over the past month. They could never get through to service dispatch. I was told multiple times that I would be called by them in 24-48 business hours. In frustration, I took the TV to the store where I was informed that they couldn't take the TV back or help me in any way without authorization. I called concierge services again and went through the usual pattern of waiting while they tried to reach someone in service. After yet another 30-45 minute call, I was given the number to call service myself. Late last week I was finally able to get a call through to service dispatch. I was given instructions how to take 4 pictures and email them in. I did this. I still didn't hear anything. I resized the pictures in case the files were too large and resent them. several days later still nothing so I called again. I was told that the pictures didn't clearly show all four corners of the TV, but I had trimmed the photos down to just the TV to make the file smaller. I was informed that I need to take all of the pictures again and resubmit. them wait 2-3 business days before checking back. They will not reach out, you must continually call them. So, I guess I am venting because I will likely not have resolution until next month, at least after Monday. Is this typical?

Costco,1621958914,nktcu8,What would you do I don’t even no anymore...,"This isn’t to bash Costco or look for sympathy on here I just genuinely have to get this off my chest, it’s caused me great stress, feel very uncomfortable at work when I use to love coming in. Imma about to drop some really wild stuff so strap in and I won’t be using names , locations so please don’t ask. 

I have been working for Costco about a decade I’m a maxed out employee with bonuses and work part time after being a ready now ft membership supervisor. I am part time now because I literally can’t be in there for more then 25 hours and if I could be in there less I would as the place literally gives me breathing problems anxiety and sweaty palms.  Why you might ask well I’ll tell you I have been holding this in for a long time being “tough” about it but can’t no longer so here we go. Below I will let you know things that happened personally to me that I just don’t think is right in any business.

1st incident- When first starting out for whatever reason I was told by people and even managers that some assistants think I was a known drug dealer and peddling out of Costco. Never have never will ,because I smoked weed and kinda talked about it openly I guess they thought some things fair enough. What wasn’t fair was being called to the podium by my manager and him telling him to open my hand so he could put those little Pandora bags in there. When I asked him why are you giving me these he told me I thought I could use them , I lost it told him that was unprofessional and to stop I have clean record and don’t sell drugs.

2nd incident - sexual harassment and being attacked. A new female employee started and some of the younger co workers were calling her a sl*t. At that time I was using a word that was slang that was used by all managers as it was joke we all said to each other , one day I called her the name we all called each other and she lost it, and told an assistant. The assistant asked me if I callled her a sl*t I said no and said I called her the word that we all use including managers which he then had a meeting with them and apparently told managers not to use it. The word isn’t bad it was a joke that everyone used, including her but I guess because the other employees were involved she got mad I was accused of being a ring leader and was told by my assistant to stop preying on “hoes” and that guys like me would be in prison. Never been suspended from school no record and have a good family background. I was so mad that I went back after the meeting and called him out for attacking me , he told me to shut up and I was gonna get written up never should of signed that but I was fresh into Costco.

3rd incident- now for some reason managers would always try to talk to me think I was cool unno but they would always tell me things and even go as far as telling me too hook up with as many f/e chicks I could. One night I was out with some girls and went to a hotel and we went upstairs to a suite where an assistant was there waiting for the girls me chicken wings booze you name at the end of night the girls left for a sec and watching tv with the assistant this guy puts on porn I feel hella uncomfortable and tell the girls I’m leaving back to the room.

I am in Canada and the department I have applied for is pharmacy. Keeping in mind that my availability starts from June 1st (due to my school and the manager was fully aware of it), it has been 2 weeks since she hired me and I still haven't heard back about my orientation date. I did contact the manager last week and she said she is still waiting to hear back as well. So I am starting to get worried. Like I haven't signed any document or whatsoever.

Costco,1621859757,njwy7s,Costco Recipe #3: Genovese Pasta Sauce &amp; Salt Pork,"Hello fellow Costconians!

&amp;nbsp;


[Recipe #1](https://old.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ghwkqs/costco_recipe_1_honeypecan_granola/)

[Recipe #2](https://old.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/gky8jw/costco_recipe_2_quinoa_broccoli_cheddar_casserole/)

&amp;nbsp;

Recipe #3 is a double feature: Genovese pasta sauce along with homemade salt pork. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm really excited about sharing this one because it's honestly one of the most delicious pasta sauces I've ever made. It freezes very well and is a great addition to your meal prep rotation. It will make 8-10 portions. Serve over any short-cut pasta, like rigatoni or penne, sprinkle on some freshly grated [parmigiano reggiano](https://i.imgur.com/FIVxzpO.png). 

&amp;nbsp;

---

### **Required equipment:** 

* [7.5 quart dutch oven](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0039UU9UE) or [8 quart stock pot](https://smile.amazon.com/Cooks-Standard-02520-Stainless-Stockpot/dp/B01M9CZAXG), or anything larger

### **Optional equipment:** 

* [Quarter sheet pan and matching rack](https://smile.amazon.com/USA-Pan-1604CR-Bakeable-Nonstick/dp/B06XZZ3P6F), or something similar

* [Digital kitchen scale](https://smile.amazon.com/Kitchen-Scale-Bakers-KD8000-Weight/dp/B00VEKX35Y)

---

&amp;nbsp;

### **Notes:**

***This is an all-day recipe!*** You will have to plan your time for this one. I assure you, it will be worth it. It can be done in as little as 9 hours, if you are fast at prepping, but allow for 12 hours, at most. Total hands-on time for prep and the sauce is about 2 hours. If you start at 8am, expect to be finishing up by around 8pm at the latest, so don't plan on serving this the same day. It's even better the next day anyway!

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to make the salt pork as well, you will need to start it at least 2 days before starting the sauce. 

&amp;nbsp;

It is optional, but I recommend to dry brine the chuck roast over night. This will greatly enhance the flavor and texture of the beef. If you are making the salt pork as well, make sure you have enough room in your refrigerator. Steps to do so are included below.

&amp;nbsp;

Do not use any vessel less than 7.5 quarts in size. My 7.5 quart dutch oven was filled to the brim, literally, and it is difficult to stir at first. Once the onions begin to reduce it becomes easier. You could use something smaller, but you will have to add the onions in batches as the onions reduce and create more room. This will also add some amount of active and inactive time to the process. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you are skeptical about the amount of onions in this recipe, I assure you that the final product will be completely different than what you think. Cooking onions this long completely breaks them down, and they will not resemble an onion in appearance, taste, or texture. The taste is actually quite incredible. Think french onion soup. A bit sweet, very savory, and soooo satisfying. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

## **Salt Pork:**

### **Ingredients:**

* 4 pounds [pork belly](https://i.imgur.com/tYNm4up.jpg), 1/2"" thick strips
* 16 ounces salt (a bit more than 1.5 cups)
* 7.5 ounces sugar (a bit more than 1 cup)

### **Instructions:**

1. Combine salt and sugar in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. You can't use too much salt for this, if anything, err on the side of too much rather than too little. 

2. In a bowl or other vessel large enough to hold all the pork belly, sprinkle a solid layer of the salt mixture on the bottom. 

3. Working one strip of pork belly at a time, coat each piece liberally with the salt mixture, lay the strip down on top of the salt mixture layer on the bottom of the bowl, repeat this until there is one solid layer of pork belly on the bottom of the bowl.

4. Sprinkle another even layer of salt mixture on top of the new layer of pork belly. 

5. Repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 until complete, make sure to use all of the salt mixture.

6. Cover, refrigerate for two days. 

7. After two days, working one piece at a time, rinse off salt mixture from surface of pork belly, slice each strip into 1/4-inch chunks. Separate into 16 ounce portions and store in a Ziploc bag. Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for indefinite storage. Properly cured salt pork has a very long shelf life, please do your own research on this and store how ever you see fit. I am only suggesting an extremely conservative time. 

## **Genovese sauce:**

### **Ingredients:**

* 6 ounces salt pork
* 2.5 pounds choice beef chuck pot roast
* 1/2 cup diced celery, 1 or 2 ribs
* 1/2 cup diced carrot, about 1 medium carrot
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2/3 cup dry white wine (sauvignon blanc works well)
* 6 pounds yellow onions, sliced

### **Prep (mise en place)**: 

* *Optional*--Dry brine the beef overnight (no longer than 24 hours). Sprinkle all surfaces of the whole chuck roast (don't cut it yet) with coarse kosher salt, let it sit in the fridge overnight, uncovered, preferably on a wire rack. You want a decent amount of salt, a light coating, nothing too crazy. If you don't have a wire rack, you can fashion something out of aluminum foil, chopsticks, or skewers. The goal is to allow for air flow below the roast so that all surfaces can sufficiently dry out. A dry surface makes for better browning; better browning makes for better flavor.

* Slice all onions. To minimize tears, use the sharpest knife possible, cut onion in half across the stem and root, give each half a quick rinse under cold water, and then [slice in the pole-to-pole direction](https://youtu.be/weFT03Mcah0?t=428) and discard the stem and root ends.
* Dice celery and carrots
* Measure out tomato paste, save the remaining tomato paste by smearing into an ice cube tray, freezing solid, and then transfer to a Ziploc freezer bag and store in freezer for future use. 
* Measure out white wine
* Cut chuck roast into about 2-inch chunks. If you *did not* dry brine, sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of kosher salt (1.5 teaspoons table salt) all over the beef. If you *did* dry brine, *do not* add any salt at this point.

### **Instructions:**

1. Add about 1 teaspoon oil to your cold dutch oven or stock pot. Add 6 ounces of salt pork, smear around to coat the bottom of the pot with the oil. Turn the heat on to medium. Cook until most of the fat has rendered out, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer salt pork out of the pot and into a large bowl (you will be adding more to this bowl later).

2. Turn the heat up to medium-high, when the fat in the pot begins to smoke. Working in 2 or 3 batches depending on how wide your pot is, add a third or half of the beef in one loose layer, do not overcrowd the pot. Cook undisturbed until a nice brown crust forms, 3-5 minutes, flip and continue to brown the beef on all sides. Keep an eye on the bottom of the pot. You want a dark brown fond to form, but do not let it burn. If you see it turning black, turn the heat down. Once beef is browned, transfer into large bowl with the salt pork, repeat with remaining beef. 

3. Once all beef is browned and transferred out of dutch oven or stock pot, reduce heat to medium. Add celery and carrots, cook for about 5 minutes or until softened, stir in tomato paste, cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until tomato paste begins to caramelize on the bottom of the pot, do not let it burn (brown is okay, black is not). Add white wine to pot, begin scrapping up all browned bits from the bottom of the pot until the bottom is practically clean. 

4. Add all reserved beef and salt pork to the pot. Add all onions, or as much as you can fit. Cover the pot, cook undisturbed for 30 minutes over medium heat. Stir everything well, cover, and cook for another 30 minutes. Stir again. 

5. Reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for 8 to 10 hours, stirring occasionally, every hour or so. When stirring, skim off any fat that is pooling on the surface. As you get closer to the end, keep an eye on the liquid level. If things seem too dry, you can add a bit of water as needed. 

6. The sauce is done when onions have completely broken down and you cannot distinguish between the onions and the beef. Taste the sauce and add more salt if needed, or add more water if it's too salty. If you add too much water you can continue reducing over low heat.

| Salt pork | 6 | 0.264  | $1.58 |
| Beef chuck roast | 40 | 0.313  | $12.50 |
| Celery | 4 | 0.15 | $0.60 |
| Carrots | 4 | 0.05 | $0.20 |
| Tomato paste | 1 | 0.111 | $0.11 |
| White wine | 5.37 | 0.276 | $1.48 | 
| Onions | 96 | 0.036 | $3.46 |

&amp;nbsp;

Total cost: **$19.93**

Cost per 10 servings: **$1.99** (not including pasta)

&amp;nbsp;

In comparison to prices for each ingredient from my local grocery store, the total cost of everything is $30.22, or $3.02 per serving.

If I make this dish 6 times using Costco ingredients instead of grocery store ingredients, the savings will pay for my membership. 

&amp;nbsp;

### **Variations:**

* Replace the salt pork with pancetta
* Use a mixture of red and yellow onions
* Add some beef broth when reducing the onions

I called customer service and the only thing I was told was appliances are taking longer to be delivered right now so it probably wouldn’t be a problem. I was hoping to get a more concrete answer than that.

Today I went out to the back yard to check on the feeder (it hold 2 pounds) and saw it was empty, but the birds are specially picking out and only eating the black sunflower seeds, not the other little round ones that are in the mix. 

Well, the problem is, sunflower seeds are just under half of the mixed seed amount. The birds knock the rest of the seeds on the ground to get more sunflower.

*  So tomorrow is my first 8 hour shift. From what I've read, I can't work more than 5 hours straight without a lunch I think? Also when I do go on lunch, do I have to tell anyone or is that kind of like my 15 minute breaks?

* So it seems like to me stocking kind of ""ends"" when the store opens. Was curious about who I should go to next to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing? It seems like from what I've read, front end work is pushing carts, cashier assistant and working the snack bar. I'm also wondering if I'll be trained on those things or if it's a ""trial by fire"" kind of thing.

* Finally, I think one of the women who work HR told me if I'm going from AM stocking to like ""open store hours"" work that I can't wear a t-shirt and cargo shorts. So I'm wondering if that means like polo and khakis or something similar? Any clarification would be great.

Several years ago (I believe in 2014), I tried out Costco. I got a pair of clear 1.67 glasses and a pair of sunglasses in polycarbonate. To make a long story short, the sunglasses in poly worked fine but I could not focus on the 1.67 pair. The optician checked the Rx and offered to remake them in a different frame. Same issue. 

Since 2014, I've purchased another pair of sunglasses in the poly material and again, I have zero issues (I love the polarization and mirror finish!). Well, I'm in need of another pair of sunglasses, and I'm told that you no longer offer polycarbonate lenses -- that you recently switched manufacturers. Is that correct? 

So there's a few questions raised in my experience. Why do you think that your 1.67 lens material didn't work for me all those years ago? Something to do with the physics? And lastly, now that you've changed manufacturers, do you think I will run into the same issue again)? Or is the manufacturer who makes the 1.67 lens also making the 1.6 as well?

The product page last month indicated if I pay for it with the Costco Citi card I'd get back $250. This type of promotion was on a lot of product pages. I just can't find the conditions now though.

If I return the item for replacement I am worried it may mess up the promo and make it seem like I returned the original item and bought it back again in May.  If that were the case I may bite the bullet and deal with Swann RMA process. $750 may be OK for this system but $1000 is a bit much.

Costco,1621083644,ncyd9h,Mohawk LVP Flooring and Costco,"We've been looking for almost a year for LVP flooring that's waterproof to replace the older laminate in our home.  We needed approximately 1700 square feet, every location except the bathrooms, needed new flooring.

We shopped all of the local and national home-improvement stores, and when we saw that Costco was selling Mohawk, we called / emailed and asked for floor samples.

We compared those samples sent with the quality and prices being asked by the home-improvement stores and one local flooring store, and decided based upon the quality and the return / guarantee of Costco that we would pull the plug and purchase.

We waited until it went back on sale at $39.99 per box, placed our order, watched our sales savings show up, and then realized that the shipping fee of $250 from other stores was also included.  

We just had it installed (finally!) after waiting almost two months for our installer to put us on the schedule.  He was impressed with the quality, asked me about the pricing -- and when I told him that the price included the shipping from the factory he was impressed.

We could NOT be happier with this choice, with the service / shipping from Costco to Mohawk and even the return services of the unused boxes.

If you are thinking about upgrading one of your rooms and/or your house and considering LVP, do consider Costco.  Read what others are saying on the reviews, and watch for the sales.  Right now, all of the previous eight options of this flooring are sold out on the website.

The reviewers said not to purchase the transition pieces because the coloring was off, so we simply took a sample to our local flooring store and purchased enough for our transition into our bathrooms and laundry room.  

The reviewers warned about rocking chairs, office chairs, etc. and to use mats, even though this flooring is 'scratch proof.'

The one bad thing that we kinda realized as they were pulling up the older flooring is that this flooring is thinner, so all of our baseboards will need to be touched up and repainted.

And one of the bigger tips we read / learned was to order 15% more, watch for batch numbers, etc.  A lot of the reviews said that the shipping was horrible, and I think instead of sending the flooring via freight, they were shipping it via UPS / Fed Ex -- and the boxes were damaged.  Since ours was a larger order, it was shipped and delivered via freight and contained on pallets.  We had not one broken box in the delivery.

While many complained that the board width was not consistent, that problem must have been fixed, as each box that was opened and reviewed was the same width, had no cracks, and we only had one board that wasn't finished properly.

With a household of dogs, sand, water, soon-to-be returning visitors, we couldn't be happier with our savings and quality.

My only wish is that Costco / Mohawk would recommend local installers.  We choose the professional installers as we needed their expertise to remove all of the previous room transitions installed.  Our flooring is now seamless, no more tripping over that stupid transition.

Props to Mohawk for a fine product and Costco for providing a cost-savings way of upgrading homes.",1.0,1,22

Costco’s outdoor furniture is such a great value for the money, I’m having trouble surrendering the dream, ha! Would anyone here in the know have any insight? Would really love this or a handful of others (also sold out) but wondering if I should throw in the towel and just move on?

Costco,1620942481,nbsbwq,Just got hired at Costco as a stocker and I have a few questions.,"So I recently got hired as an AM stocker at a Costco somewhat near me. Not gonna lie, the orientation to me at least seemed overwhelming as hell. Im recently coming from a Home Depot as a freight associate. So I figured Costco ""should"" be in the same type of work.

Anyways, a few of my questions are:

* Can I work this job as a process of clock in, do pallets, break, do pallets, clock out and go home? Or is not as straightforward as that?

* The guy training us really hampered on cross-training. Can I treat this job as a straight stocking position or will Costco ""force"" me into other areas?

* Is every day a hardworking day or are there some days when it's easier to other to you?

I ask these questions because Im kind of unsure as to what I've gotten myself into with this job. All the descriptions and video of the ""stocker"" role I watched were just pallet work.

So I called the Costco concierge service and the person there told me that a second appointment is *not* required for a dishwasher ""unless they can't fit it into the space or whatever.""

So now I'm totally confused.  Can experienced Costco dishwasher recipients fill me in here? How does this work?  In particular:  

(1) is it one appointment or two?  

(2) If two, how/when/with whom do you make the second appointment? 

(3) Is it my responsibility to detach my current dishwasher so that it's ready to be carted away?

(4) If the answer to (3) is yes, and the whole process requires *two* appointments, must I detach my current dishwasher before the **first** or the **second** of the two appointments?

(5) Why on earth does the Costco online ordering experience not explain this process? (that question is rhetorical...)

I have gotten only $33.13 after spending over $6k. Feels like I have exhausted all my options to no avail. But firstly want to say I have been a executive member for almost 3 years now and got the Citi card and love it. 

 

 It all started 3 months back. I saw that I had only accumulated $4.15 for the last 10 months. My Citi card had $85+. So I went to the customer service counter and they couldn't explain it at all. They did some looking around and found out we had spent about $4500 in the last 10 months.  Then asked me a few questions. ""Did you buy a lot of gas?"" no, covid working from home. ""Have you been returning a lot of items?"" nope. The folks behind the counter talked within themselves for a few minutes asking each other questions, gave up, took my number told me they will reach out to their manager and get back to me. 2 weeks passed nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I went in again, this time some other person was there. He asked the same questions. Again took my number and said he would call. I asked if I could get some kind of a service request/ ticket number he said no. It has been 6 weeks, haven't heard anything.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was waiting I also called the customer service number. Told them what happened, same questions. They said they will do an investigation. Again I asked if I could get a ticket/service request number. They said no but they also said they will update my account profile and would receive an email. Haven't received anything not even a email confirmation.

Things that are drawing me to Wireless Advocates:

- Higher base pay. Was offered $15/hour, currently make $11.

- Potentially higher opportunity to make sales with Wireless Advocates offering all three carriers. Comparably, my company only offers one (AT&amp;T).

- Potentially better inventory and opportunity to advance.

Some questions I had:

1. What are sales metrics like?

2. How busy are the kiosks, and will a large portion of the job consist of actually “finding customers?

3. If you have an off month, will you be threatened with termination?

4. What are average commission checks like, and how easy is it to make commission? 

My company defines highly productive sales people as making $3-$4 an hour in commission. The person I spoke with at Wireless Advocates told me he defines that as “mediocre”.

So I was at Costco the other day, minding my own buisness. I finished shopping and went to the checkout lines. I don't know how your local Costco is laid out, but for ours, the technology section is a few steps away from the checkout lanes.

So my kids (12 and 9) went to go to the tech section after asking mew permission to go and see some new devices. So I just sat there in line watching them to make sure they were ok. 

Now I was carrying 3 of those larger carts full of those like 8 feet tall bush tree things, I was in the process of re-landscaping. So as you could imagine, it wasn't too easy trying to push 3 carts, watching the line, and watching my kids. 

Just so you know, dear reader, I speak Romanian. 🇷🇴 I lived in Romania until I was about 25 years old, so English is my second language, I am more fluent in Romanian.

As I was in line, pushing carts, watching kids, whatever, I hear a bratty middle aged woman say, in Romanian, ""Hai să mergem la altă linie, crețul ăsta s-o pus să doarmă în picioare"" Which means ""Lets go to another line, this curly haired freak fell asleep while standing in line.

At that point, I should have said something like ""Why thanks for waking me up"" or ""man, I'm lucky you were here to awaken me"" but I didn't, I just stayed there. After around 30 more seconds, I called for my kids to come back, in Romanian though.

A number of friends have recommended I sign up. I’m a single person and currently spend around 200$ a month on groceries. When looking at the prices of most things I’d only get about 20 articles for this budget. I then have to buy dog food but my dog is allergic to chicken so options are limited - he has pedigree beef kibble. 

I stopped by today to have a walk around, and I was immediately told I wasn’t allowed in without a membership, so I went to the counter and they came to the conclusion I had to get a membership. The person I was dealing with said I could get refunded if it wasn’t beneficial. All in all it took about 20 minutes to get the card and all, they recommended the executive card because of the cash back etc and then I walked around. 

Going to the dog food they had the same as the one I get for my dog but it was 7$ more a bag which was unfortunate. I was looking around at all the food and obviously trying to figure out how the price ways out in terms of long term over a month. If I was to get fruit/veg/milk I’d have to still go again at some point and it’s an hour drive away. I have a fair amount of freezer space but not enough for some of the size of these boxes. 

It just doesn’t really seem beneficial to me, I just want to make sure I’m not missing something before I give up my membership. I feel really bad because they spent ages going over everything.

\- apparently Costco members have a separate customer service number for faster service.

Anyway, they said the equivalent of no, it’s completed by ready fresh. So I decided to just wait and google it when I got home. Ready fresh is owned by nestle, my guess is they just needed a different name to get people to be okay with buying their water dispensers, as nestle obviously carries a bad name. And yes, I know ozarka is bottled by nestle as well.

I bought the 2 packs of Dave bread about 10 times so far. The price is great and it is convenient to get it from Costco. 

However, one time when we got home we discovered that one of the loaves of bread had already been opened and a few slices were gone.  Does Costco allow people to return bread? I sure hope not.

Then on another occasion, when we got home we discovered that one of the loaves had a big rip in the bag.  So we discarded that loaf. 

The savings we are getting from buying these 2 packs was already pretty minimal because my family can barely finish the second loaf before it goes dry or moldy.

I called Costco Optical for questions about contact lens fitting exams. Surprisingly, they said there’s no fee for a contact lens fitting exam! I assume it’s a Costco membership benefit or something. Just need to bring in an up to date glasses prescription. 

Then I asked for their prices on daily Toric contact lenses. They don’t carry the CooperVision MyDay Toric! I asked for my second option which I was fitted with before, the Acuvue Oasys 1-Day for Astigmatism. The contact lens fitter (assuming it’s an optician) said it’s $120 CAD per 90 pack. 

Now, that price didn’t seem so exciting. I then asked the local optical store I go to for the price today. They said $205 CAD total for a 90 day supply. I assume that is 2 boxes of 90 packs for each eye. That means $102.50 CAD per box. I did know before that this independent optical store has extremely fair prices on glasses and contact lenses, but that was surprising. I know all the online contact lenses retailers are severely overpriced compared to this optical store. 

Does Costco not have the best prices on contact lenses in Canada? Is the no fitting exam fee the advantage when it comes to contact lenses at Costco? Now that I’ve found out prices it makes me wonder if it’s worth bothering with Costco at all. Maybe Costco told me the price for both eyes (aka 2 boxes), it’s hard to tell…",1.0,1,6

I recently applied for a meat cutter position at Costco and was told the only way to become one would be to either work in the meat department not as a cutter or to wait and see if any new locations open up that are willing to bring in outside hires. If I went with route 1 I'd be taking a decent pay cut and come in hoping I'd eventually get the position I want. My questions for anyone who is currently or has been a meat cutter with Costco is: 

1) Is it worth taking the pay cut to come in at their minimum and hope a spot eventually opens up? 

2) How long does it typically take for people to move up into a meat cutter position?

I'm deciding on a couple of job opportunities I've reached out for the interim to who aren't going to require me to work 5 days a week, and before I pull the trigger I'd like to ask how do I quit? 

May seem like a stupid question but I've never formally quit a job before (last job was like a small business type deal) and don't know how I go about it. Do I contact payroll first? Do I leave a letter in the GM's mailbox? I want to leave on good terms because I've been a good employee and will definitely need the reference for the specific career path I'm taking.

(Btw: For those about to say so, I'm aware Costco has an employee designation where you DON'T have to work 5 days a week as long as you have some kind of deserving circumstance and are approved by the GM, but my warehouse is notorious for leading employees on about it when they ask. One employee I know was straight up told she'd get it and it took like 10 follow-ups (with the managers and GM) over two months for her to finally work it out.

I did a big NO and dated a coworker. I know why people advise against it, and I know I messed up in doing so. We dated for a month max and then I realized that he wasn't the greatest person and broke it off. I privately asked him to keep it between us and told him we need to maintain professionalism at work.

Literally the day after we broke up my daughter came down with serious COVID symptoms and I wound up needing to take off to be with her.

Since the break up, which was roughly two weeks ago, he's gone off the deep end and completely slammed my reputation at work. Lied entirely about the reasons behind the break up. Got almost all of our coworkers far too involved. Keeps slamming me on Facebook. Pretty much every immature, petty thing a person could do after a break up to try and ruin the career of another... he's doing.

I've been contacted by five coworkers about the break up and I haven't even been back to work yet. I'm incredibly anxious about my return on Wednesday. It's now a hostile work environment because the messages I've been getting have ranged from simply unsympathetic and disappointed to straight up thinly veiled threats.

Is it worth a sit down with management to discuss what has been happening so that I don't walk into a minefield after two weeks of nursing a COVID positive four year old back to health? Aside from this, I'm a wonderful employee. I've been here almost a year. No conduct issues on my end. I want to keep enjoying my job but this is just unraveling it before my eyes.

And yes, I know, I messed up dating a coworker. But I feel like this is a pretty unfair price to pay for doing something that many people around the world do.

So this month Costco has the canopy for $99. Obviously a better deal, but no store has it in stock. I've been to three so far. 
Why does Costco put items that aren't I. Stock in the sales flier. You have no way of getting this great deal, it is just vaporware.

A number of people chimed in asking the same question.  I bit the bullet and bought them, so here's information on them for anyone who wants.

https://www.costco.com/pendleton-national-park-collection-pillow%2c-2-pack.product.100752869.html

If you like not-fat pillows, these are perfect.  They're not much wider than the gusseted edge, and they're firm but not so hard you can't bend them and fold them if you want. (I sleep on my side and wedge them a little under my neck sometimes.)

I've been using them for five days now, and I'm going to buy another set so I have pillows on hand that work for me when this set wears out. (I have such a hard time finding pillows that are comfortable, when I find some that work for me, I like to buy extras.)

As for why they're a ""national park collection"", the colors on the side are the colors of (in this case) Pendleton National Park. Apparently the collection has other colors, but these are the only ones Costco carries.  (Edit: Since I ordered mine, Costco added three more color options!) Also, some money from each purchase is donated to the parks.

While these get a big thumbs up from me, pillows are a really personal item.  If you like a not-fat, solid pillow, check these out!  Side sleeper me loves them.",1.0,1,11

I ordered and received a set a few weeks ago and have enjoyed seeing them in my yard. They're fairly large. The colors vary some between the leaves: in the promo pic on the website (pic 1) you can see that some are predominantly orange while others have more purple or blue. Most of mine are the purple/blue variety (pic 2), though the colors change a little bit based on how light hits them.

I come home and go up to my apartment and I see no package. I start to worry but I contact costco. This is where my 20 days of hell started and is still ongoing.

The lady tells me no and to wait 3-7 business days. 8 business days go by I get no email or call. So I decide to call them and they told me to get a police report. I get a police report that same day the 15th. The item arrived the 6th of this month (April) to give you all a time frame. I call them back and send this information to the costco investigations team. I was told to wait 1-2 business days for a email.

Does that mean they hook it up but it might take a second appt?

Costco,1619402771,myn6xj,"Let's Talk Kirkland Branded Liquor &amp; Wine, what's good and what should be avoided?","Specifically asking because this sub (and myself included in this) has noted that a bunch of suppliers have changed and not for the better. I'm going to need to do a bar stock up soon, so I wanted to crowdsource notes to be ready. 

The bad:

* I have noted the American vodka went from great to just ok, but a noticeable drop in quality. I am wondering if I should try the french Vodka instead of switching to skyy or some other stuff. 
* I don't think the spiced rum was ever really that good. Way too cinnamon forward, not enough rum flavor. 


The products I did like and haven't seen any changes with:

* I liked the Gin, but I heard they changed suppliers on this sub, so I can't say I still recommend it. I wanted to know if more people had flavor different notes.
* Silver Tequila. Not for sipping but great for mixed drinks (Margs and Palomas)
* Malbec Wine: genuinely good and amazing for the price
* Prosecco: great for brunch mimosas/bellinis, but a bit sweet on it's own for me personally (others i know IRL disagree)
* Irish Whisky, cheap and good. Not the best but i'd make whisky sours for this easily. 
* 12yo Scotch (not the best I've tried but amazing for the price. I don't feel guilty sipping this on a random night).  
* Irish Cream: Just as good as bailey's 
* Boxed Red Cabernet: I use this for pan sauces and sangría. It does the job well. Not the best wine for depth of flavor though

If I bring my new wheels off the car to the tire shop, they should install them right? But if I bring the car in to get them rotated or something, they'll maybe decline? I guess mostly what I'm asking is what is their current policy on aftermarket wheels and tires. Does it vary per store?

 Today I arrived at dealership A, was shown the same quote, same Vin, produced Costco card, took a test drive (different VIN). Went back in to finalize price. Sales rep asked about financing, told her I was pre-approved thru the Credit Union I'm employed at. She left, came back and said she made a mistake with the quote. Said they couldn't take a 10k hit on price. I left and called the 2nd dealer to meet.

 I verified his earlier-in-the-week quote and make and model + year for clarity. His reply was yeah they only make Carbon Edition CX-9 for 2021. Again I texted rep 20 minutes later at Mazda dealership B with price CX-9 Carbon Edition. His reply was ""Yes"" and I said I'll be there in 30 minutes. ""sounds good"".  18 minutes later I get a call, text, email that said he mis-quoted me but at least he gave me new Costco pricing and didn't just push the MSRP in front of me like Mazda dealership A.

I called Costco so I could get a different dealership to provide quotes for next week. The rep was wonderful. She asked what happened at the first two, and showed genuine concern. I explained the above and apparently a consumer advocate will call me soon.

There was one delivery delay after another and it finally arrived today.  

The arm of the loveseat has 5 small, half-inch inch visible cuts/perforations in it.  The delivery guys saw it and I told me to log it on the receipt/acknowledgment form, which I did.

I called Costco this evening and they said the item was out of stock and they could not offer a replacement and would only accept a return of both items as they are a set.

 They then offered $75 dollars compensation in lieu of a return.

I thought this sounded weird, and when I expressed I just wanted a replacement loveseat, but would have to return because for $4k the damage wasn't acceptable they said ""how about $110""?

Is this normal? 

I dont even know what the fair compensation value is for a damaged loveseat on a $4k set, but I know it's not $100 .  Furthermore, I simply just want the damaged piece of furniture replaced!

Costco,1618970369,mv5vmq,Costco chicken preparation for one,"Nobody else in my household likes chicken (strange, right?) so when I pick up a Costco chicken it’s all up to me to eat it. I find it’s hard to eat the whole thing before it goes bad though so maybe I could use some advice as to how to divide it so I can make multiple meals out of it? 

Basically the way I do it now is when fresh I eat both legs and wings in one meal with some rice and veggies. Out of one half of the breast, I can make about 3 sandwiches (I like the breast on sandwiches more than stand alone). I’ll have a sandwich usually for lunch and dinner the next day and lunch the third day. At this point, the chicken is about 3 days old and I still have half the breast plus two thighs left. At this point I may be able to make dinner the third day with it but the chicken isn’t as good really and by the fourth day I feel it’s sketchy to eat the rest so I usually end up throwing about 1/4 of it away. 

This is  pretty wasteful, usually not a concern because it’s so cheap but I really am trying to cut down on food waste and it’s just not efficient how I tackle this chicken. What would be a good strategy to eat this thing whole before it goes bad, without over-eating?",1.0,1,11

We contacted Costco online to see about simply exchanging the bad mixer for a new one, but they're out of stock for the red color, and are therefore insisting on a refund-only; apparently the different color qualifies it as a different item in their system. We actually don't care what color we get at this point; we got it on a sale for $80 less than its current price, and therefore don't want to refund and re-purchase at a higher price.

Has anyone had success moving around this blockade? From our perspective, we just want a working mixer of any color at the price we originally paid.

Every sectional I look at seems to have a good number of positive reviews but many negative ones that make me very hesitant to pull the trigger. A few things that are often mentioned and would be a big deal to me are inadequate seat depth, cushions being too firm and never softening up, and lack of durability (fabrics quickly developing wear marks/foam not rebounding/etc.)

No preference between fabric or leather, although if I go leather, I definitely want top grain and won't cheap out. My favorite fabric option is the [Langdon](https://www.costco.com/.product.1356640.html), and my favorite leather option is the [Luca](https://www.costco.com/.product.1351194.html)

Costco's website is not specifying all the items included in the bundle but we called Lovesac directly to confirm and you ARE receiving all the bells and whistles given in previous roadshows (coasters, table, citysac, etc). All throughout the processing and shipping process, we continued to receive prompt and thorough communication from Lovesac directly. Most of our items showed up less than 6 days later, despite a quote of 3-4 weeks. The citysac is back ordered so we are still awaiting this item. 

Now less than 2 weeks after the order was placed I am sitting on the couch typing this review. We are thrilled with the experience and purchase. I believe there are several factors that contributed to this being a successful experience:

* we have the privilege of having 2 Lovesac stores within driving distance, and we made sure to go more than once to test drive the merchandise and ask lots of questions. Sitting on the seat is key and really think about how you'll be using it. We're binge movie watchers and parents of a 2 year old so comfort long term and durability are key for us. We found both so far here. 
* I asked questions to the salespeople directly, and confirmed over the phone. This refers to the first time I went in to Lovesac to ask if Lovesac still honors their warranty with items purchased through Costco. That salesman said no. I called corporate to confirm and they let me know that was not the case and that once you purchase from Costco, everything is fulfilled by them directly and handled directly, same as any other Lovesac purchase. Now that I have received my order I can confirm this was exactly the case. The only thing I would involve Costco in is if I had wanted to return my purchase. 
* I read lots online and watched some of the youtube review videos. 
* I went in with the expectation there would be tons of boxes and there were. We made sure to have our old couch cleared out an open space for the incoming boxes. We watched Lovesac's 3 Youtube videos on unboxing, putting on covers and assembling to help us put everything together. We kept our workspace clean as the videos suggested, breaking down boxes and grouping like items. We found it to be stress-free and a very easy process. If we HADN'T know there would be 30 huge boxes coming, however, I can see how that would cause so much stress. 
* I knew that this Costco bundle only allowed for the choice of standard inserts and would not allow (as purchased) for the deep seat. You have to purchase the deep sides for the deep seat. I saw a lot of people making returns because of this reason. Now keep in mind - the seats included in this bundle WILL work for a deep seat. You just will have to purchase a deep side (or several, depending on formation) for the deep sit. If you don't know this, hear it here. If you have the ability to go into the store and try it out - do so. I am shorter than my husband and found I prefer a deeper seat. He is 6'4 and didn't mind the standard seat, however, he is a couch layer so that is what he was excited about. I got around my neep for a deep seat by designating my side the ottoman side and that has been working out tremendously for us so far. 

I can confirm after shopping around and in-store that you're not going to find a better deal than the Costco deal if you like the colors the bundle is being offered in. The coasters are fantastic, the table is functional both on the pillows OR as a lap table (fits my laptop, phone, beverage and room for more!) and the blankets are AMAZING - heavy, warm and so chic. The sqattoman is actually really cute and comfortable. The included throw pillows are large and squashy and even the basic covering that comes included is growing on me. My son was excited by the furry nature of the squattoman so I can't wait until he sees the Citysac and loses his mind. All in all, we are really happy and it's great to have gotten something new that I wanted for such a smoke show deal. If you're considering making this purchase, hopefully this post helps you out!",1.0,1,33

I've always had very positive experiences shopping at Costco. That said, we purchased a dishwasher online. It was a great deal, especially when ""white glove delivery and installation"" are included in the price...however, things did not turn out as nicely as I'd expected. 

Costco  has great prices on major appliances, but their delivery and  installation is the worst I have ever encountered. Who delivers a  dishwasher with promised ""white glove delivery and installation"" and  then just leaves the appliance in a box in the garage and informs the  customer that the actual installation is scheduled for a week after the  delivery date?! Add to that the fact that Costco does not do uninstalls  of dishwashers (or any ""built-in"" appliances), so we'll be washing  dishes by hand for a week, because we paid a plumber to do the uninstall  the day before the dishwasher was expected.

 A call to ""Costco logistics"" only served to confirm that there were ""no  installers available"" for the next week. A subsequent call to Costco  customer service resulted in a $25 credit to the card used for the  purchase. $25...so Costco is willing to pay me $25 to wash our own  dishes by hand for a week (about $3.50 per day)!

Costco,1618427002,mqxhns,Feeling frustrated with customer service,"I bought an LG dishwasher 2 weeks ago. I am always concerned about well what if there is a sale right after I buy but luckily costco is really good at price matching their sales if within a reasonable time. 

The issue is the nicer dishwasher that was $350 dollars more than the one I bought went on sale for $300. I asked them since I ended up having to install the dishwasher myself if I could pay the difference and have them deliver the nicer one and take away the old one and install the new one. No.

I asked since the product I bought is inferior and from the same company if they could please give me at least a $200 dollar discount and the response is no.

Their solution is to have me remove the dishwasher myself. Bring it to the warehouse and return it, then wait for the new dishwasher to come and be installed by their team. 

Why cant they just take the old one back when they install it? Why can't they give me a discount on a product that is obviously not as good but is now the same price as the better version.

We all really appreciate you and you're the best part of our trip. Thanks for being there and chatting us up when checking out. 

I love that idea. It's time to expand it asap to every Costco and then work on taking it in the store so you can just hold it up to the reader. I use Apple Pay inside Costco probably most don't and this could speed up lines. You scan the fob for your membership and if you agree with the price hit ""yes"", grab your receipt and go away (with your mask still on hopefully). 

I love Costco and I love the people who work there. They are very fast and they literally make shopping there better but imagine how much better it would be if they could just skip one step.

I know Costco isn't that huge on tech stuff but one of the reasons I also shop at Sam's Club is the Scan &amp; Go feature. I love walking by everyone in the store and just heading for the door. It saves a damn ton of time and that has to save them money. I don't compare Sam's and Costco in terms of anything other than that. They are not the same. I shop at Sam's for the stuff that Costco doesn't carry. 

As much as I just love Costco as much as all of you it really is a nightmare to actually pull in and go shopping. I don't want them to really change that much because when places do, they turn into freaking Kmart. Have you been in a Kmart in the last 10 years? They are the Kohls of Walmart's and that is why they are going to shit. Costco is so much better than that and smarter. But they one thing they can for sure improve on is payment options to save time.

Costco,1618000577,mnq3in,Disappointed by KS for the first time: KS Dishwasher Pacs,"I've always been a KS fan, and I really wanted the KS Dishwasher Pacs (abbreviated to KSDP for brevity below) to be my new go-to.  I  bought them almost a month ago and I'm disappointed.  Facts:

* Previously used Cascade and didn't have any complaints except occasional large pieces (own fault)
* Switched to KSDP expecting similar performance for lower cost (typical KS proposition)
* We moved to a new apartment shortly after switching to the KSDP and I noticed that more fine particle residue was sticking to the dishes.  
* I continued using KSDP for a month thinking that the new dishwasher was the culprit (went from Whirlpool to GE)
* After researching, found similar experience from others and decided to exchange remaining pods for Cascade Complete
* Zero food residue with Cascade Complete since

Observations:

* I think Costco tried to do too much with the product, it advertises that it's safe for septic systems and chlorine free which may limit it's cleaning power (how big could the septic market be that they thought they needed to address it?)
* It seems Costco has realized this as well as they now have a new version in store that advertises ""30% more cleaning power and better fitting pods."" 

I mostly wrote this as a vent post and also to inform others.  I'd be interested to see if anyone has tried the new version and seen better results; I was tempted but I dislike dirty dishes and so gave it a pass for now.",1.0,1,0

I got a set of new tires installed on my Prius and had a set of OEM replacement TPMS sensors installed at the same time (that I purchased separately), the tire manager claimed that their equipment was not compatible with any sensor that they do not sell. Is this BS? 

Is this just costco being cheap (like no windshield squeegees at the gas pumps)?  
Or do they purposefully purchase tools that are not compatible with 95% of TPMS sensors?

I would be fine with it if they had just said that it was their policy to not program TPMS sensors that they did not sell, but it seems like they were lying to me (claiming that the equipment was not capable of it).

Are there any opinion on their furniture? I’m moving to my new house and shopping around for sofa, bed and dining table. I know they have limited collection in store and online. I’m wondering how they compete in terms of price and quality with other furniture specialist stores. 

I would appreciate any experience and buying tips.",1.0,1,11

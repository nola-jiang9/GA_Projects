Closing shifts on weekdays also don't have enough people in them and sometimes the warehouse forklift workers dont even drop the stuff we need for tomorrow.

Theres also so many orders now for this small kitchen, I feel like no matter how many people you put in the kitchen, the result will still the same because it's just too overpopulated.

Costco,1623425740,nxitqx,Nightmare of a delivery experience,"Ya'll I'm at my wits' end here.

I get a discount through work on appliances through LG. And they use costco logistics (innovel solutions) to deliver. I placed my first order for a refrigerator early april, item is scheduled for delivery beginning of May. They call and tell me it's raining so they can't deliver and will reschedule. I'm like whatever, fine. 

They delivered the item in a coupled of days, installed it and walked out before I got a chance to inspect it, it had a dent in the front, so i had to get them to to come pick it up for return the next day and I placed a 2nd order. It took a couple weeks for it to reach the warehouse and I finally got to schedule it for this monday. The 2 hour window  comes and goes, nothing from the delivery people yet, i called their support and the lady said she has no idea why but it was rescheduled to wednesday but it was on the truck for delivery and they didn't finish the route for some reason and thats why it got rescheduled, i'm like WTF nobody told me and I had to take the day off for this to stay home. She was like im sorry etc etc for your trouble and said it would be delivered on Wednesday. Tuesday evening i was supposed to get a call with my 2 hour delivery window - that didn't happen, I called support and they were closed. So I call first thing wednesday morning and the agent says he has NEVER seen this happen before but one system says it was scheduled and another didn't so it didn't actually get scheduled for delivery and he scheduled it for friday. So that's 2 days off wasted. And now it's friday, and i get a call from the warehouse saying they don't have the right item?! I'm LIVID. How was it on the vehicle for delivery on Monday if they never had the right item in the first place ? He said he has no idea how this was missed and will talk to the origin warehouse and see whats happening.

This is so fucking ridiculous. And costco support can't even help me with some kind of refund for all the trouble because my order is through LG. And LG doesn't have a support number for me to call through because it's a b2b partner website and my emails go unanswered for days -\_- I'm frustrated with both costco and LG. 1 month in the new house without a refrigerator.",1.0,1,25

Costco,1623387374,nx7qo4,Regarding a possible two weeks notice.,"Greetings fellow Costco employees,

I have been working at Costco for almost a year now (10 months) and have been greatly enjoying my job, even if it has been part-time. 


I’m looking into putting in my two-weeks notice however, as I am getting interested in a different job that may have room for growth in a field I am interested in. 


What I want to know is if I decide to put my two weeks notice in, when is a good day to put it in and who do I give it to?


If it helps to know, I have a very good relationship with all my managers/supervisors. I’ve done my best to work my butt off working in the front end and have even helped a tiny bit with morning merch (enough to be offered a position). I think I may have one tardy, but as far as I know I have no write ups or counseling notices.

Costco,1623378445,nx53xu,Transfer Request,"So my wife has been promoted within her company but they're relocating us to another nearby state.

Costco,1623285504,nwaqdd,Serious questions about Furniture and Appliance orders for shipping,"We're having a house built and it's slated to be finished on or around 8/26. When it comes to things like the King Bedroom Sets, do I need to put all the items together myself? 

I'm slightly freaking out. This is so much. We're going to be a lot more broke than we thought. With work getting slowed so darn much from COVID to the chip shortage we're going to have damn near nothing in our savings when we move in.

So the home we rent now is a 3 bedroom 1 bath at 925 sqft. The home we're having built is 2227 sqft. We don't even come close to having things to put in it. 

We have two young boys. We are good on their stuff. We need a bedroom set. Also the sofa we have now is beyond dead and the only reason we haven't gotten rid of it is because we need to save as much as we can to throw at the downpayment, closing costs, ect. 

So we have a living room set on order at a furniture store here in town. It's 3 pieces, two sofas and a char. We put down $600. I think the set was slightly over $2600. We're going to have to cancel that now and we'll lose $100 in breaking the agreement but we can't do that now. We'll be $3k off what we thought we would have. And that's the best case right there.

But our credit card is empty and we always report a zero balance. We only use it for things we are already going to buy just for the rewards and pay it monthly. So when we get in we can get our bedroom set and then pay it off and get a living room set.

I'm also going to need to do a washer and dryer and wonder if they will deliver it upstairs where the laundry room will be. 

Idk I made this post because I'm just freaking out and this sub is really great and helpful. And I'm sure some of you understand the position I'm in and I'm hoping to get some good insight into something I may have overlooked. 

When you have so much to think about you are bound to overlook something that should have been obvious.

I had no idea I'd wind up at a Costco at 5pm on a Sunday evening as they were closing the Tire Center.

Rami, who might be a supervisor, looked for appropriate tires and showed them to me. Then he said he'd try to get approval to mount them after hours. Well time dragged on as my son and I had difficulties finding a way to pay for the tires. **Nota Bene!** Costco  does NOT accept Master Card debit or credit cards! That was all we had between us, a couple each but all Master Cards. Also, the ATM inside the store, which Rami got us access to, doesn't work with Master Card debit cards, my son was unable to get cash. Strangely, when I later tried with my European debit card (Master Card), I was able to get cash.

So the tires were paid for and a very (extremely) patient Rami and his associate, whose name I unfortunately did not get, mounted and balanced the tires and all work was finished pretty close to 6pm. Amazing!

Of course I tried to give them a tip but they refused saying something about a fine (or did he say fired?) if they accepted. He asked me to leave a nice review instead - no problem!

Costco,1623272375,nw67cw,My Costco Story,"I purchased a washer and dryer....

I recently received an email from Costco requesting feedback from my experience. I want to make sure my experience does not just stay in a survey so I am writing here some of what I wrote on the survey. This has been the worst experience I've ever had with any retailer in my life.  From the long wait, the lack of truthfulness from Costco representatives and the delivery team. 

When I initially received the W/D the stacking kit was missing. It was my fault because I was not aware I needed one since my previous W/D did not require one. The delivery team contacted the Costco rep to notify the stacking kit was missing. I was advised by the Costco rep over the phone that I should order one through Costco Online or Amazon and as soon as I receive it to notify them in order to send the delivery team for installation. I immediately logged in to Costco Online just to find out that the item was not sold separately. I decided to chat with the rep who told me to order to item from amazon and then call back. I asked her if she could wait a minute as I was placing the order at the same time we were chatting. I purchased the item and advise her. She reached out to Costco Logistics to schedule the appointment. It turned out that the Costco Logistics team stated that I would lose any warranty because the stacking kit was not purchased from Costco and the Delivery Team will not install anything that what's on the box they deliver. The Costco rep stated that my only option was to cancel my order and purchase a new W and D with the stacking kit. By them, the Delivery team had already left my house with my old washer and dryer and the new ones left in my garage. I advised the Costco rep the delivery team was gone to which she replied that they will not turn around because I accepted the delivery.

So at that moment, I found myself with no washer and dryer so I placed a new order for which I had to wait almost two months and about the same time for them to pick up the new ones left in my garage. Yes, they could not use the new ones sitting in my garage. I had to get new ones.

Once I received the new ones, the Delivery Team told me that the W and D will not fit in my laundry room. Yes, this was after I was the previous team had installed the washer from the first delivery. After going back and forth with the now disgruntled and repulsive delivery guy who even told me that he would install them but if they did not fit he was not going to take them back. Once upstairs he refused to place the W and D on top of a dripping pan to protect the home from water leaks.  At that time I was so fed up due to the entire situation that I decided it was not worth arguing with the guy. I can also continue ranting but for what.

Costco,1623258240,nw0sqs,Kirkland peanut butter rancid? :(,"About a month or so ago I noticed something terrifying. My Costco peanut butter smelled and kinda tasted rancid. 

* YES i always refrigerate it after opening it, immediately after stirring it
* IMO it's the best peanut butter out there, it's perfect
* HUGE peanut butter fan, eat it constantly
* I DID open another jar, just to check it it was that one, but same result :(
* Testing by other people has been inconclusive. I have at least 1 person saying it's all in my head, and another saying no, it does smell strange. 

I'm wondering if there was a bad batch? I have a third unopened jar that I'm willing to open, but I'm honestly afraid it will also smell/taste rancid. 

It's not un-eatable, but it does smell and taste different. I did catch COVID a while back (October) and have wondered if that affected my taste buds? But the timing is off, and no other foods have been affected.

I'd expected breaded/battered cauliflower - I guess I overlooked the ""paleo"" and ""keto"" buzz words on the labelling.

The instructions warn you to drain the broth from the ""sous vide"" vegetables, and once you open the package and smell it, you understand why. Even with the broth drained, the cauliflower in the finished dish was plasticky or chemical in taste.

The 2 sauce bags contained the General Tso's sauce - okay in flavor but just a plain cornstarch-based sauce.

The guys ended up arriving at my house unannounced... I had a bad feeling about things once that happened.  Sure enough, the guys were really rough with the tv and packaging, opened the box and seemed surprised by how thin the tv was (as if they'd never installed a new tv before), dropped the tv out of the box and damaged the corner of the screen, and moved random stuff in my house that didn't need to be moved (I just don't like it when people touch stuff without asking beforehand, as I had cleared the entire living room beforehand to make enough room for them anyway).  Needless to say it was a really bad experience.

Thankfully though, when I called costco to describe the experience, the were very nice, refunded the install fee, and will be back next week to switch the tv out with another one.  I just hope it's not the same people again because that would be really awkward.

I placed the order on 5/29, card was charged 6/04, and it was delivered and installed yesterday 6/06. Everything went great and we love the  fridge. I went back to look at the item page online to look up its dimensions and I saw on the product page it says "" **Receive a $200 Costco Shop Card. Shop Card will be subject to forfeiture if the order is returned. Please allow 6-8 weeks for processing once your order shipment is confirmed. Offer valid 5/30/21 through 6/26/21.

Is there any way to know for sure if my purchase qualifies? The online support person basically said wait 6-8 weeks and you will know if you did. That is not super helpful lol. I  would have waited a day to order had I known. Anyway, any insight is appreciated! Thank you.",1.0,1,8

2. Kanzi - A hybrid of a Braeburn and Gala.  Very crisp, but not as sweet as a Wild Twist.  My Costco just got these and they're a good substitute for the WT (which I'm clearly partial to), but a little tart and not quite as firm. 
3. Envy - Flavor is mild and sweet.  Not as crisp as I prefer.  This is a hybrid of a Royal Gala and a Braeburn which is super interesting because it's pretty different from the Kanzi.  Typically in stock at my Costco and a good back up.

Inconvenient, but not a huge deal. 
Now we have gotten a new puppy, plus still have the 2 small dogs and they have discontinued the puppy food we were using now too (yellow bag). This is so frustrating. It was basically the puppy version of the Red Bag food so it was going to be a seamless transition to the dog food that we're using for the other two, but now we had to switch to the nature's domain puppy food (teal bag) with completely different ingredients until the time that our four month old dog is able to move on to adult food with the other two.

Costco,1622998760,ntq7w1,Oversudsing with KS Ultra Clean Laundry Detergent,"The KS Ultra Clean liquid laundry detergent was on sale so I decided to give it a shot since it had pretty good reviews.  It was a pretty bad experience for me, but YMMV.  The scent is a little strong, but the real problem is how sudsy it is, especially since I have a front load HE washer.  The suds would build in volume and not rinse away easily, unlike most HE detergents.  I reduced the dosing every time to basically a teaspoon, would use an extra rinse, but it was still very sudsy and my towels were getting stiff.  I don't have soft water either (pretty medium, San Jose CA area).

&amp;#x200B;

Then I had 2 loads of laundry throw an error on my machine mid-wash.  I searched online and the error code means that the machine is overflowing with water (it wasn't) or there are so many suds that it's tripping the overflow sensor.  I did notice the pump seemed to be running excessively long when initiating a spin cycle.  I re-washed that load with just water, and a lot of soap came out.  Then I ran the machine clean cycle and the amount of detergent build up after \~1 month of use was incredibly bad.  I knew the detergent had to go back.  Thankfully, Costco is great with returns, and I found my interaction with the CS rep interesting:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hi, I'd like to return this please.  It's way too sud...""

""Clogged up your machine?""

""Yup.  Clearly you must get this a lot?""

""All the time.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just wanted to pass along a warning of my experience with this product.  It seemed to clean well, but it started to damage my washing machine, and apparently I'm not alone.  I switched back to Tide (which was actually way cheaper on sale at Safeway than at Costco), and everything works perfectly again.  No more suds, build up, or error codes, and my towels are softer and fluffier again.",1.0,1,14
Costco,1622994220,ntoknq,2-day shipping: isn't,"I was extremely happy when the Costco website introduced the 2-day shipping and 1-day shipping features. The nearest Costco is a little bit of a drive away and I can't always make it. So the new shipping options would help me order cheese, meat and snacks right to my door. Or so I thought. 

I have previously ordered using 2-day shipping, where one of my items was delivered (I kid you not) after two weeks. No harm, no foul, things happen. The other stuff that was supposed to be delivered in 2 days wasn't delivered in 2 days either. You know, not a problem… it was a new feature then. 

But I recently ordered with 2-day shipping again, and it's been 2 days yesterday, and the order status still shows ""order is being prepared"". I have a feeling it won't be getting delivered before mid-week next week. 

Contrast that with the experience we have all had with Amazon. When they say ""two day delivery""… they mean two day delivery. 

As retail industry has moved on and evolved, I am fearful that Costco will be left behind. I love the company and what it stands for. I love that they treat their employees much better. I was hoping Costco will set yet another standard in home delivery logistics while maintaining their reputation for treating their employees well. 

I am willing to forgive Costco a lot of things just because I'm not donating to the Bezos Empire every time I need something delivered to my house. Because this current order was delayed, won't mean I will die. But I do want the best for Costco, and I am afraid that most customers just want delivery to be held to the Amazon standard. 

To be relevant in twenty years from now, Costco has to step up its home delivery game by a big, big, big margin. 

This is somewhat of a longer post. I hope it doesn't come across as a rant. I'll continue to shop at Costco as long as I can.",0.99,1,198

The latter seems like the best deal to me. The storage size (64GB vs 128GB) is a dealbreaker, which makes the Pro the best option here. By comparing the prices with Apple’s website, the Air is already listed at $30 less so I’m assuming the Pro has a price reduction too.

Costco,1622820921,ns7zcj,Supply Chain Economics,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img fssmp197q9371...*

Last week I purchased these Melona frozen bars. Price approximately $0.35/each in box of 24. They tasted OK. I looked at ingredients and discovered they were made in Korea.

That made me think about what seemed to me impossible supply chain economics.

Made/frozen/packaged in Korea then shipped to my west coast Costco. 

1. Freezer truck to airport or shipping port in Korea.

2. Frozen shipping on plane or ship. 

3. Freezer truck from US port/airport to Costco. Customs fees etc.

4. Unpacking and stocking in Store. 

5. Cost of maintaining frozen until sold.

How is this even possible at this price? Are there freezer containers on ships? Are bulk air freight for frozen goods that low?

Probably not the correct reddit to ask this question but maybe someone here has an insight how this might work. If these were made in SF or LA I could understand the economics but Korea?",1.0,1,14

I am a little nervous about applying because I do not want to apply for a warehouse job when I physically can't do it because of strength, obesity, etc. 

So, I was just wondering if someone who has this position or the box crew position can give me a run down of what responsibilities they have like:

1) What typically does the AM stocking position do? I understand that they stock the store in the morning before opening but what specifically do they do. 

2) How physical/straining is the AM stocking position?

Costco,1622629834,nqipxw,Super afraid of having membership revoked due to 3 out of 4 portable ACs failing and needing to be returned,"I've had terrible luck.  I've purchased four portable ACs from Costco over the last nine years and three of them were defective, failing within 18 months, four months, and the new one I got last week had broken caster wheels and started leaking after only two days of operation.  

Despite this failure rate, I've told literally dozens of people that Costco is THE only option for buying a portable AC.  If you look at reviews on Costco and other sites, all portable ACs have like a 20-30% failure rate, and the manufacturers' warranties are worthless because you have to pay hundreds of dollars in round-trip shipping to utilize them.   The Costco return policy is your only protection against getting a $500-700 lemon.  I'm so passionate about protecting my friends and coworkers from this possibility that I've done everything except grab people by their lapels to get them to order through Costco rather than Amazon et al. 

Well, now I've received my third AC lemon in ten years and it has to be returned.  We're of course going to replace it with another Costco portable AC, but I am TERRIFIED that I might get my membership revoked for doing another ""big"" return.

I think I'm a good Costco member!  I have the Anywhere card and I bought my home and car insurance through Costco.  I use Costco Optical and Pharmacy.  I shop at Costco once a week for groceries and that's my only gas station.  

I do maybe two or three minor returns a year for issues like a foam pillow having a strong chemical odor or a clothing item not fitting.  Never anything stupidly abusive like returning a dead Christmas tree or a rotisserie chicken carcass or an 8 year old printer.  

But returning a third portable AC unit freaks me out!  Does this seem like too much? Should I preemptively talk to a supervisor or the store manager?  Does anyone have any insight into what might trigger Costco to cancel your membership?",1.0,1,18

Costco,1622606149,nqcr6q,I have worked at Costco for 15 years. I feel so depressed.,"I have been in almost all ancillary departments except, hearing aid, optical, photo, and tire center...  

My love is the deli, I started in the deli, and I wanted to move up, I was told it would be easy,  just work hard and learn as much as you can.

I learned meat department, food court, front end, member services, did S.I.T, went back to the deli, and I am a merchandiser.   I have always wanted to move up in the deli, for years I put in for supervisor spots, and was told, someone with more seniority, or knowledge, always got it, and I needed to know other areas of the warehouse.  Cool, I did that!

I tried again a few years later, was told I was was not knowledgeable enough with the AS400, and reports.  So I learned what I could access. 

Tried again. 
Was told I didn't know the Lingo enough.  Like the acronyms.   Okay. I went back to my manager and begged her to teach me. My department is one of the busiest in the region.  She refused  because we are too busy and she doesn't want to waste precious time outside of me and producing because I am one of her top producers.

She bullies and verbally tears down her crew of people and everyone is so used to the terrorizing ways we just take it and kept our heads down.  

Like I want to move up so fucking bad. Yet I have been told so much I am too nice, too talkative. Too friendly.  I have been told I will never move up over and over again by my old manager. 

I tried again recently,  I feel broken and so disheartening because even after 15 years of being a sponge, working my ass off, I am never good enough.  I know I am fat. I know I am not always the fastest. I get my job done.  What the fuck does it take to move up anymore.  It seems I must need to be a total brown noser or worse. I am not buddies or friends with managers,  nor do I want to be. I stay clear of being too friendly outside of work. I have seen some absolutely atrocious people be moved up who have no clue how to manage, have horrid communication skills. And yet they are all managers. 

Costco has broken me. I love and I hate Costco, but it's all I know, and I love working in the deli.  I want to be a deli manager some day but now I know.  I will never be anything but a grunt.

Costco has destroyed any self confidence I have had in the past. I have applied for over 13 years to probably 100 different supervisor spots. Nothing.  I came close once. I used to interview well, but my old manager did a number on my head, I stumble on my words and get so nervous now. Because I fear rejection, I know I am already rejected before I even try. They always have someone picked out anyways. Interviews are usually just formalities now days.  

I have been passed up for people I have so much more knowledge and experience on, and it will come to light they have family members that are managers in other stores,, its just so damn disheartening.   I don't know why I even try anymore.  Costco has destroyed my desire to be anything better because the rejection is destroying me.  Because they just want their good grunt workers to stay down so they can be pushed to the breaking point.  

I am so damn sad, angry at myself for wasting away my life and never getting farther. I wanted to grow with this company, I wanted to teach and help people grow. I wanted to be a deli manager. I am just the fat, annoying talkative person. I want to know what will make me good enough.  Will I ever be good enough? 
I have always been told I am a good teacher, patient, kind and very knowledgeable,  but its never enough!

YET, on the 21st I saw a large purchase that would have been sense using the Costco Citi promotion and applied for a card on Costco's website at the checkout screen. This is important. After being approved I realized I only received an email for the last 4 digits of the card. Couldn't sign up on Citi's website with that info, but amazingly if I wanted to renew my Costco card (that was due in a few days...) I could see the card's last 4 on Costco's website, so OBVIOUSLY there was some form of communication between Costco and Citi, even if I couldn't use the card to renew (or check out)

Called Costco that following Saturday after going into the store to inquire about how to pay for this large item. Got a temp card to renew my stuff, but the temp card doesn't work online. Gotta call Citi. Called Citi. Was told I have to wait for the physical card in the mail - no way to expedite. NO WAY TO EXPEDITE?!?!? So at this point I've likely pulled a hard credit to get a CC that I can't use. No virtual cards and no way for Citi to help me pay for what was on Costco's site.

Now, I almost focused my hate exclusively on Citi as they issued the card...BUT COSTCO ADVERTISES SIGNING UP FOR THE DAMN CARD WHEN CHECKING OUT!!!! Imagine if you were about to drop $4k on something on Amazon and they were like ""hey, sign up for our CC....thank you. You're approved! Now wait 7-10 business days for the actual card to come in the mail before purchasing. But don't worry, we'll send hourly reminders that you have items in your shopping cart!!!!!""

Last Weds I got a notice in the mail...that my card was on its way. Full of promotional crap that had no bearing on me. Naturally my large purchase went Out of Stock the day the promotion ended and now I have a CC that I couldn't use. I'll wait for a 4th of July sale or whatnot just so I can exercise the warranty feature, but if that wasn't the case I'd use my Discover card, get that 5% back for warehouse purchases online, and dip. 

Costco: You shouldn't try to pimp a card at the checkout screen if folks can't use it ASAP. Citi, you shouldn't act like you can't expedite a card for first-time issues. If it was a replacement I could have allegedly had it FedEx, which blew my mind. Furthermore I read on a forum that if you claimed you were doing international travel that may trigger the release; I shouldn't have to lie to get a card to use!

Costco makes almost all profits on membership dues.  Sales minus costs and admin (salaries) wipes out all sales essentially.  

Membership renewal rate is almost 90%, very strong

Same store sales have continued to grow, at 16% increase

TIL Costco has their own chicken farm and two beef farms to supply their meat products

Costco opened their first store in China last year.  While they have stores in Taiwan, Korea and Japan already.

This first store in China is their largest and after one year produced 400,000 memberships!  It's in Shanghai, one of the largest cities but still! 

They have 2 more Chinese stores under construction in China.

I watched a video of the CEO walking through the store showcasing how great the low prices were.  The host asked if they could make more by raising the prices and the CEO laughed so hard!  ""That's not us!""

Costco's Mission:

""Here at Costco, we have a very straightforward, but important mission: to continually provide our members with quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices.""

Costco stock pays a dividend, but occasionally they will pay an extra dividend to reward investors!  Yes, their great service extends to shareholders too!

Memorial Day means we are closed Monday and we all get holiday pay. The schedule for Memorial Day week was posted, and I had my regular weekday off in addition to the holiday and Saturday—so three days off this week for the holiday. 

But on the original schedule, those employees who usually had Monday or Tuesday off lost their third day off for the week. They only had Monday and Saturday. This upset them, so a few complained to the manager. She told them they were causing trouble for the business. Then, this Wednesday, she redid the schedule for next week and took away the weekday off for every single part time employee.

However, since the nearest Costco is a minimum of 2 hours away (possibly less transfers?) and I would be coming in pre-trained, I was feeling pretty hopeful when I applied.

I am curious to know when to expect a response from them- will they contact me even if they’re rejecting my application? I also asked that they not contact my current employer because I haven’t told my employer I’m applying for a new job- will that hurt me since I asked them not to contact the only place where I have optical experience?

Costco,1622221403,nn2e37,"I hate this job, just want to transfer but can’t. Help.","I’ve worked at costco for two years. I hate every waking second of it. The complete lack of training, braindead management, rampant nepotism, sexual harassment, revolving door of employees, and fickle safety procedures are just a few of my concerns. Our warehouse manager asking Covid-positive employees who didnt show symptoms to still work their shifts is yet another concern.
Being screwed out of my Covid bonus as a part timer who works full time hours is, again, yet another concern.

When I started, I really gave it my all, but it slowly faded, starting with when they promoted a man in the warehouse who was well known to sexually harass every female coworker in the store, all because he was cozy with management, not because he was even remotely close to fulfilling his job description.

The only reason I’ve stayed at all is to transfer out of state then immediately look for something else after moving. I’ve been sending out transfer requests and job bank applications left and right since the start of this year, and can’t seem to secure anything or get any opportunity to leave my warehouse. I’ve put in for almost 40 jobs, interviewed for about half of those applications. Nothing.

Look, I’m remaining cautiously hopeful that this is just my current store, not the company as a whole. I would love to transfer to see if an older more established warehouse has it’s shit at least somewhat together. But what now? I’m in great standing, near perfect attendance, perfect reviews, and even letters of recommendation, but I get nothing but transfer denials, rejection letters, or just complete radio silence on any job transfer I apply to.

Is it even worth trying to transfer with this company? Because my mental health means much more to me than Jelinek’s stock going up a quarter of a percent.

I have always told people they should buy TVs from Costco because they are a no hassle return/repair/replace store. I said this having never returned anything before. I used the concierge system once and was directed how to reset my TV which solved my issue back then. Last year I bought a TCL 50"" from Costco, and it worked great. Thirteen months later, the TV failed by displaying only vertical purple and black bars. I have gone through at least 7 - 10 calls over the past month. They could never get through to service dispatch. I was told multiple times that I would be called by them in 24-48 business hours. In frustration, I took the TV to the store where I was informed that they couldn't take the TV back or help me in any way without authorization. I called concierge services again and went through the usual pattern of waiting while they tried to reach someone in service. After yet another 30-45 minute call, I was given the number to call service myself. Late last week I was finally able to get a call through to service dispatch. I was given instructions how to take 4 pictures and email them in. I did this. I still didn't hear anything. I resized the pictures in case the files were too large and resent them. several days later still nothing so I called again. I was told that the pictures didn't clearly show all four corners of the TV, but I had trimmed the photos down to just the TV to make the file smaller. I was informed that I need to take all of the pictures again and resubmit. them wait 2-3 business days before checking back. They will not reach out, you must continually call them. So, I guess I am venting because I will likely not have resolution until next month, at least after Monday. Is this typical?

I am part time now because I literally can’t be in there for more then 25 hours and if I could be in there less I would as the place literally gives me breathing problems anxiety and sweaty palms.  Why you might ask well I’ll tell you I have been holding this in for a long time being “tough” about it but can’t no longer so here we go. Below I will let you know things that happened personally to me that I just don’t think is right in any business.

1st incident- When first starting out for whatever reason I was told by people and even managers that some assistants think I was a known drug dealer and peddling out of Costco. Never have never will ,because I smoked weed and kinda talked about it openly I guess they thought some things fair enough. What wasn’t fair was being called to the podium by my manager and him telling him to open my hand so he could put those little Pandora bags in there. When I asked him why are you giving me these he told me I thought I could use them , I lost it told him that was unprofessional and to stop I have clean record and don’t sell drugs.

2nd incident - sexual harassment and being attacked. A new female employee started and some of the younger co workers were calling her a sl*t. At that time I was using a word that was slang that was used by all managers as it was joke we all said to each other , one day I called her the name we all called each other and she lost it, and told an assistant. The assistant asked me if I callled her a sl*t I said no and said I called her the word that we all use including managers which he then had a meeting with them and apparently told managers not to use it. The word isn’t bad it was a joke that everyone used, including her but I guess because the other employees were involved she got mad I was accused of being a ring leader and was told by my assistant to stop preying on “hoes” and that guys like me would be in prison. Never been suspended from school no record and have a good family background. I was so mad that I went back after the meeting and called him out for attacking me , he told me to shut up and I was gonna get written up never should of signed that but I was fresh into Costco.

3rd incident- now for some reason managers would always try to talk to me think I was cool unno but they would always tell me things and even go as far as telling me too hook up with as many f/e chicks I could. One night I was out with some girls and went to a hotel and we went upstairs to a suite where an assistant was there waiting for the girls me chicken wings booze you name at the end of night the girls left for a sec and watching tv with the assistant this guy puts on porn I feel hella uncomfortable and tell the girls I’m leaving back to the room.

To be continued if you guys want because this has to be in six parts or more and gets even more twisted it won’t let me post full",1.0,1,8

I am in Canada and the department I have applied for is pharmacy. Keeping in mind that my availability starts from June 1st (due to my school and the manager was fully aware of it), it has been 2 weeks since she hired me and I still haven't heard back about my orientation date. I did contact the manager last week and she said she is still waiting to hear back as well. So I am starting to get worried. Like I haven't signed any document or whatsoever.

Costco,1621859757,njwy7s,Costco Recipe #3: Genovese Pasta Sauce &amp; Salt Pork,"Hello fellow Costconians!

&amp;nbsp;


[Recipe #1](https://old.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/ghwkqs/costco_recipe_1_honeypecan_granola/)

[Recipe #2](https://old.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/gky8jw/costco_recipe_2_quinoa_broccoli_cheddar_casserole/)

&amp;nbsp;

Recipe #3 is a double feature: Genovese pasta sauce along with homemade salt pork. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm really excited about sharing this one because it's honestly one of the most delicious pasta sauces I've ever made. It freezes very well and is a great addition to your meal prep rotation. It will make 8-10 portions. Serve over any short-cut pasta, like rigatoni or penne, sprinkle on some freshly grated [parmigiano reggiano](https://i.imgur.com/FIVxzpO.png). 

&amp;nbsp;

---

### **Required equipment:** 

* [7.5 quart dutch oven](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0039UU9UE) or [8 quart stock pot](https://smile.amazon.com/Cooks-Standard-02520-Stainless-Stockpot/dp/B01M9CZAXG), or anything larger

### **Optional equipment:** 

* [Quarter sheet pan and matching rack](https://smile.amazon.com/USA-Pan-1604CR-Bakeable-Nonstick/dp/B06XZZ3P6F), or something similar

* [Digital kitchen scale](https://smile.amazon.com/Kitchen-Scale-Bakers-KD8000-Weight/dp/B00VEKX35Y)

---

&amp;nbsp;

### **Notes:**

***This is an all-day recipe!*** You will have to plan your time for this one. I assure you, it will be worth it. It can be done in as little as 9 hours, if you are fast at prepping, but allow for 12 hours, at most. Total hands-on time for prep and the sauce is about 2 hours. If you start at 8am, expect to be finishing up by around 8pm at the latest, so don't plan on serving this the same day. It's even better the next day anyway!

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to make the salt pork as well, you will need to start it at least 2 days before starting the sauce. 

&amp;nbsp;

It is optional, but I recommend to dry brine the chuck roast over night. This will greatly enhance the flavor and texture of the beef. If you are making the salt pork as well, make sure you have enough room in your refrigerator. Steps to do so are included below.

&amp;nbsp;

Do not use any vessel less than 7.5 quarts in size. My 7.5 quart dutch oven was filled to the brim, literally, and it is difficult to stir at first. Once the onions begin to reduce it becomes easier. You could use something smaller, but you will have to add the onions in batches as the onions reduce and create more room. This will also add some amount of active and inactive time to the process. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you are skeptical about the amount of onions in this recipe, I assure you that the final product will be completely different than what you think. Cooking onions this long completely breaks them down, and they will not resemble an onion in appearance, taste, or texture. The taste is actually quite incredible. Think french onion soup. A bit sweet, very savory, and soooo satisfying. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

## **Salt Pork:**

### **Ingredients:**

* 4 pounds [pork belly](https://i.imgur.com/tYNm4up.jpg), 1/2"" thick strips
* 16 ounces salt (a bit more than 1.5 cups)
* 7.5 ounces sugar (a bit more than 1 cup)

### **Instructions:**

1. Combine salt and sugar in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. You can't use too much salt for this, if anything, err on the side of too much rather than too little. 

2. In a bowl or other vessel large enough to hold all the pork belly, sprinkle a solid layer of the salt mixture on the bottom. 

3. Working one strip of pork belly at a time, coat each piece liberally with the salt mixture, lay the strip down on top of the salt mixture layer on the bottom of the bowl, repeat this until there is one solid layer of pork belly on the bottom of the bowl.

4. Sprinkle another even layer of salt mixture on top of the new layer of pork belly. 

5. Repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 until complete, make sure to use all of the salt mixture.

6. Cover, refrigerate for two days. 

7. After two days, working one piece at a time, rinse off salt mixture from surface of pork belly, slice each strip into 1/4-inch chunks. Separate into 16 ounce portions and store in a Ziploc bag. Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for indefinite storage. Properly cured salt pork has a very long shelf life, please do your own research on this and store how ever you see fit. I am only suggesting an extremely conservative time. 

## **Genovese sauce:**

### **Ingredients:**

* 6 ounces salt pork
* 2.5 pounds choice beef chuck pot roast
* 1/2 cup diced celery, 1 or 2 ribs
* 1/2 cup diced carrot, about 1 medium carrot
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2/3 cup dry white wine (sauvignon blanc works well)
* 6 pounds yellow onions, sliced

### **Prep (mise en place)**: 

* *Optional*--Dry brine the beef overnight (no longer than 24 hours). Sprinkle all surfaces of the whole chuck roast (don't cut it yet) with coarse kosher salt, let it sit in the fridge overnight, uncovered, preferably on a wire rack. You want a decent amount of salt, a light coating, nothing too crazy. If you don't have a wire rack, you can fashion something out of aluminum foil, chopsticks, or skewers. The goal is to allow for air flow below the roast so that all surfaces can sufficiently dry out. A dry surface makes for better browning; better browning makes for better flavor.

* Slice all onions. To minimize tears, use the sharpest knife possible, cut onion in half across the stem and root, give each half a quick rinse under cold water, and then [slice in the pole-to-pole direction](https://youtu.be/weFT03Mcah0?t=428) and discard the stem and root ends.
* Dice celery and carrots
* Measure out tomato paste, save the remaining tomato paste by smearing into an ice cube tray, freezing solid, and then transfer to a Ziploc freezer bag and store in freezer for future use. 
* Measure out white wine
* Cut chuck roast into about 2-inch chunks. If you *did not* dry brine, sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of kosher salt (1.5 teaspoons table salt) all over the beef. If you *did* dry brine, *do not* add any salt at this point.

### **Instructions:**

1. Add about 1 teaspoon oil to your cold dutch oven or stock pot. Add 6 ounces of salt pork, smear around to coat the bottom of the pot with the oil. Turn the heat on to medium. Cook until most of the fat has rendered out, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer salt pork out of the pot and into a large bowl (you will be adding more to this bowl later).

2. Turn the heat up to medium-high, when the fat in the pot begins to smoke. Working in 2 or 3 batches depending on how wide your pot is, add a third or half of the beef in one loose layer, do not overcrowd the pot. Cook undisturbed until a nice brown crust forms, 3-5 minutes, flip and continue to brown the beef on all sides. Keep an eye on the bottom of the pot. You want a dark brown fond to form, but do not let it burn. If you see it turning black, turn the heat down. Once beef is browned, transfer into large bowl with the salt pork, repeat with remaining beef. 

3. Once all beef is browned and transferred out of dutch oven or stock pot, reduce heat to medium. Add celery and carrots, cook for about 5 minutes or until softened, stir in tomato paste, cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until tomato paste begins to caramelize on the bottom of the pot, do not let it burn (brown is okay, black is not). Add white wine to pot, begin scrapping up all browned bits from the bottom of the pot until the bottom is practically clean. 

4. Add all reserved beef and salt pork to the pot. Add all onions, or as much as you can fit. Cover the pot, cook undisturbed for 30 minutes over medium heat. Stir everything well, cover, and cook for another 30 minutes. Stir again. 

5. Reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for 8 to 10 hours, stirring occasionally, every hour or so. When stirring, skim off any fat that is pooling on the surface. As you get closer to the end, keep an eye on the liquid level. If things seem too dry, you can add a bit of water as needed. 

6. The sauce is done when onions have completely broken down and you cannot distinguish between the onions and the beef. Taste the sauce and add more salt if needed, or add more water if it's too salty. If you add too much water you can continue reducing over low heat.

| White wine | 5.37 | 0.276 | $1.48 | 
| Onions | 96 | 0.036 | $3.46 |

&amp;nbsp;

Total cost: **$19.93**

&amp;nbsp;

In comparison to prices for each ingredient from my local grocery store, the total cost of everything is $30.22, or $3.02 per serving.

If I make this dish 6 times using Costco ingredients instead of grocery store ingredients, the savings will pay for my membership. 

&amp;nbsp;

### **Variations:**

* Replace the salt pork with pancetta
* Use a mixture of red and yellow onions
* Add some beef broth when reducing the onions

I called customer service and the only thing I was told was appliances are taking longer to be delivered right now so it probably wouldn’t be a problem.

I started with a $1 clearance bag of bird seed from Walmart. I like listening to  the birds chirping outside, and our cats enjoy watching them through the window. 

Last week, my husband and I found a 50lb of birdseed for $10 at Costco, and decided it was too good of a deal to be bothered to shop around at other stores. Today I went out to the back yard to check on the feeder (it hold 2 pounds) and saw it was empty, but the birds are specially picking out and only eating the black sunflower seeds, not the other little round ones that are in the mix. 

Well, the problem is, sunflower seeds are just under half of the mixed seed amount. The birds knock the rest of the seeds on the ground to get more sunflower.

 I'm conflicted as to whether or not this is a valid reason to return the seeds. And its not like they're expensive or anything. But it feels like a waste if only half the food is going to be eaten. I don't know what to do with the rest of the large bag.",1.0,1,4

*  So tomorrow is my first 8 hour shift. From what I've read, I can't work more than 5 hours straight without a lunch I think? Also when I do go on lunch, do I have to tell anyone or is that kind of like my 15 minute breaks?

* So it seems like to me stocking kind of ""ends"" when the store opens. Was curious about who I should go to next to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing? It seems like from what I've read, front end work is pushing carts, cashier assistant and working the snack bar. I'm also wondering if I'll be trained on those things or if it's a ""trial by fire"" kind of thing.

* Finally, I think one of the women who work HR told me if I'm going from AM stocking to like ""open store hours"" work that I can't wear a t-shirt and cargo shorts. So I'm wondering if that means like polo and khakis or something similar? Any clarification would be great.

Several years ago (I believe in 2014), I tried out Costco. I got a pair of clear 1.67 glasses and a pair of sunglasses in polycarbonate. To make a long story short, the sunglasses in poly worked fine but I could not focus on the 1.67 pair. The optician checked the Rx and offered to remake them in a different frame. Same issue. 

Since 2014, I've purchased another pair of sunglasses in the poly material and again, I have zero issues (I love the polarization and mirror finish!). Well, I'm in need of another pair of sunglasses, and I'm told that you no longer offer polycarbonate lenses -- that you recently switched manufacturers. Is that correct? 

So there's a few questions raised in my experience. Why do you think that your 1.67 lens material didn't work for me all those years ago? Something to do with the physics? And lastly, now that you've changed manufacturers, do you think I will run into the same issue again)? Or is the manufacturer who makes the 1.67 lens also making the 1.6 as well?

I realized the system is defective because it reboots every several minutes. After chatting with an incompetent tech support person I was told I would need to send it to them for inspection/repair.

I could return the item to costco for a replacement for sure but one problem I have is with the promotion I relied on. The product page last month indicated if I pay for it with the Costco Citi card I'd get back $250. This type of promotion was on a lot of product pages. I just can't find the conditions now though. Does anyone know what I am referring to and have a link to some description maybe?

If I return the item for replacement I am worried it may mess up the promo and make it seem like I returned the original item and bought it back again in May.  If that were the case I may bite the bullet and deal with Swann RMA process. $750 may be OK for this system but $1000 is a bit much.

Costco,1621083644,ncyd9h,Mohawk LVP Flooring and Costco,"We've been looking for almost a year for LVP flooring that's waterproof to replace the older laminate in our home.  We needed approximately 1700 square feet, every location except the bathrooms, needed new flooring.

We shopped all of the local and national home-improvement stores, and when we saw that Costco was selling Mohawk, we called / emailed and asked for floor samples.

We compared those samples sent with the quality and prices being asked by the home-improvement stores and one local flooring store, and decided based upon the quality and the return / guarantee of Costco that we would pull the plug and purchase.

We waited until it went back on sale at $39.99 per box, placed our order, watched our sales savings show up, and then realized that the shipping fee of $250 from other stores was also included.  

We just had it installed (finally!) after waiting almost two months for our installer to put us on the schedule.  He was impressed with the quality, asked me about the pricing -- and when I told him that the price included the shipping from the factory he was impressed.

We could NOT be happier with this choice, with the service / shipping from Costco to Mohawk and even the return services of the unused boxes.

If you are thinking about upgrading one of your rooms and/or your house and considering LVP, do consider Costco.  Read what others are saying on the reviews, and watch for the sales.  Right now, all of the previous eight options of this flooring are sold out on the website.

The reviewers said not to purchase the transition pieces because the coloring was off, so we simply took a sample to our local flooring store and purchased enough for our transition into our bathrooms and laundry room.  

The reviewers warned about rocking chairs, office chairs, etc. and to use mats, even though this flooring is 'scratch proof.'

The one bad thing that we kinda realized as they were pulling up the older flooring is that this flooring is thinner, so all of our baseboards will need to be touched up and repainted.

And one of the bigger tips we read / learned was to order 15% more, watch for batch numbers, etc.  A lot of the reviews said that the shipping was horrible, and I think instead of sending the flooring via freight, they were shipping it via UPS / Fed Ex -- and the boxes were damaged.  Since ours was a larger order, it was shipped and delivered via freight and contained on pallets.  We had not one broken box in the delivery.

While many complained that the board width was not consistent, that problem must have been fixed, as each box that was opened and reviewed was the same width, had no cracks, and we only had one board that wasn't finished properly.

With a household of dogs, sand, water, soon-to-be returning visitors, we couldn't be happier with our savings and quality.

My only wish is that Costco / Mohawk would recommend local installers.  We choose the professional installers as we needed their expertise to remove all of the previous room transitions installed.  Our flooring is now seamless, no more tripping over that stupid transition.

Props to Mohawk for a fine product and Costco for providing a cost-savings way of upgrading homes.",1.0,1,22

Costco,1620942481,nbsbwq,Just got hired at Costco as a stocker and I have a few questions.,"So I recently got hired as an AM stocker at a Costco somewhat near me. Not gonna lie, the orientation to me at least seemed overwhelming as hell. Im recently coming from a Home Depot as a freight associate. So I figured Costco ""should"" be in the same type of work.

Anyways, a few of my questions are:

* Can I work this job as a process of clock in, do pallets, break, do pallets, clock out and go home? Or is not as straightforward as that?

* The guy training us really hampered on cross-training. Can I treat this job as a straight stocking position or will Costco ""force"" me into other areas?

* Is every day a hardworking day or are there some days when it's easier to other to you?

I ask these questions because Im kind of unsure as to what I've gotten myself into with this job. All the descriptions and video of the ""stocker"" role I watched were just pallet work.

So now I'm totally confused.  Can experienced Costco dishwasher recipients fill me in here? How does this work?  In particular:  

(1) is it one appointment or two?  

(2) If two, how/when/with whom do you make the second appointment? 

(3) Is it my responsibility to detach my current dishwasher so that it's ready to be carted away?

(4) If the answer to (3) is yes, and the whole process requires *two* appointments, must I detach my current dishwasher before the **first** or the **second** of the two appointments?

(5) Why on earth does the Costco online ordering experience not explain this process? (that question is rhetorical...)

I have gotten only $33.13 after spending over $6k. Feels like I have exhausted all my options to no avail. But firstly want to say I have been a executive member for almost 3 years now and got the Citi card and love it. 

 

 It all started 3 months back. I saw that I had only accumulated $4.15 for the last 10 months. My Citi card had $85+. So I went to the customer service counter and they couldn't explain it at all. They did some looking around and found out we had spent about $4500 in the last 10 months.  Then asked me a few questions. ""Did you buy a lot of gas?"" no, covid working from home. ""Have you been returning a lot of items?"" nope. The folks behind the counter talked within themselves for a few minutes asking each other questions, gave up, took my number told me they will reach out to their manager and get back to me. 2 weeks passed nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I went in again, this time some other person was there. He asked the same questions. Again took my number and said he would call. I asked if I could get some kind of a service request/ ticket number he said no. It has been 6 weeks, haven't heard anything.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was waiting I also called the customer service number. Told them what happened, same questions. They said they will do an investigation. Again I asked if I could get a ticket/service request number. They said no but they also said they will update my account profile and would receive an email. Haven't received anything not even a email confirmation.

Things that are drawing me to Wireless Advocates:

- Higher base pay. Was offered $15/hour, currently make $11.

- Potentially higher opportunity to make sales with Wireless Advocates offering all three carriers. Comparably, my company only offers one (AT&amp;T).

- Potentially better inventory and opportunity to advance.

Some questions I had:

1. What are sales metrics like?

2. How busy are the kiosks, and will a large portion of the job consist of actually “finding customers?

3. If you have an off month, will you be threatened with termination?

4. What are average commission checks like, and how easy is it to make commission? 

My company defines highly productive sales people as making $3-$4 an hour in commission. The person I spoke with at Wireless Advocates told me he defines that as “mediocre”. 

5. Overall, how is the company to work for?

So I was at Costco the other day, minding my own buisness. I finished shopping and went to the checkout lines. I don't know how your local Costco is laid out, but for ours, the technology section is a few steps away from the checkout lanes.

So my kids (12 and 9) went to go to the tech section after asking mew permission to go and see some new devices. So I just sat there in line watching them to make sure they were ok. 

Now I was carrying 3 of those larger carts full of those like 8 feet tall bush tree things, I was in the process of re-landscaping. So as you could imagine, it wasn't too easy trying to push 3 carts, watching the line, and watching my kids. 

Just so you know, dear reader, I speak Romanian. 🇷🇴 I lived in Romania until I was about 25 years old, so English is my second language, I am more fluent in Romanian.

As I was in line, pushing carts, watching kids, whatever, I hear a bratty middle aged woman say, in Romanian, ""Hai să mergem la altă linie, crețul ăsta s-o pus să doarmă în picioare"" Which means ""Lets go to another line, this curly haired freak fell asleep while standing in line.

At that point, I should have said something like ""Why thanks for waking me up"" or ""man, I'm lucky you were here to awaken me"" but I didn't, I just stayed there. After around 30 more seconds, I called for my kids to come back, in Romanian though.

Costco,1620610025,n8sjno,Am I looking at Costco the wrong way?,"Hello! So I’ve recently moved to North America and Costco here seems to be very popular. Where I came from originally, Costco was only for professionals so I’ve never really experienced a shop here. 

A number of friends have recommended I sign up. I’m a single person and currently spend around 200$ a month on groceries. When looking at the prices of most things I’d only get about 20 articles for this budget. I then have to buy dog food but my dog is allergic to chicken so options are limited - he has pedigree beef kibble. 

I stopped by today to have a walk around, and I was immediately told I wasn’t allowed in without a membership, so I went to the counter and they came to the conclusion I had to get a membership. The person I was dealing with said I could get refunded if it wasn’t beneficial. All in all it took about 20 minutes to get the card and all, they recommended the executive card because of the cash back etc and then I walked around. 

Going to the dog food they had the same as the one I get for my dog but it was 7$ more a bag which was unfortunate. I was looking around at all the food and obviously trying to figure out how the price ways out in terms of long term over a month. If I was to get fruit/veg/milk I’d have to still go again at some point and it’s an hour drive away. I have a fair amount of freezer space but not enough for some of the size of these boxes. 

It just doesn’t really seem beneficial to me, I just want to make sure I’m not missing something before I give up my membership. I feel really bad because they spent ages going over everything.

Costco,1620425124,n7ab1i,[PSA] Ready Refresh Water Delivery is Nestle,"Went to Costco in Dallas TX today and they had sales reps by the bottled water. Sales people were super nice but I asked if it was nestle fulfilling the orders, which is a big no bueno for me. Nestle has a laundry list of atrocities against mankind that is LONG, and it takes no time to figure out that they’re a fairly disgusting company. Anyway, they said the equivalent of no, it’s completed by ready fresh. So I decided to just wait and google it when I got home. Ready fresh is owned by nestle, my guess is they just needed a different name to get people to be okay with buying their water dispensers, as nestle obviously carries a bad name. And yes, I know ozarka is bottled by nestle as well.

Costco,1620245157,n5p717,Issue with 2 loaves of bread in single bag.,"Love Dave’s killer bread. Love Costco. I don’t think I will be buying Dave’s killer bread anymore from Costco due to the following issues:  

I bought the 2 packs of Dave bread about 10 times so far. The price is great and it is convenient to get it from Costco. 

However, one time when we got home we discovered that one of the loaves of bread had already been opened and a few slices were gone.  Does Costco allow people to return bread? I sure hope not.

Then on another occasion, when we got home we discovered that one of the loaves had a big rip in the bag.  So we discarded that loaf. 

The savings we are getting from buying these 2 packs was already pretty minimal because my family can barely finish the second loaf before it goes dry or moldy.

So far I’ve found out that it’s fine to book an appointment with my usual optometrist (who’s very excellent), don’t need to book with Costco’s optometrist. My optometrist includes contact lens fitting exams in a full eye exam. It made me think if Costco is cheaper to purchase contacts from. 

I called Costco Optical for questions about contact lens fitting exams. Surprisingly, they said there’s no fee for a contact lens fitting exam! I assume it’s a Costco membership benefit or something. Just need to bring in an up to date glasses prescription. 

Then I asked for their prices on daily Toric contact lenses. They don’t carry the CooperVision MyDay Toric! I asked for my second option which I was fitted with before, the Acuvue Oasys 1-Day for Astigmatism. The contact lens fitter (assuming it’s an optician) said it’s $120 CAD per 90 pack. 

Now, that price didn’t seem so exciting. I then asked the local optical store I go to for the price today. They said $205 CAD total for a 90 day supply. I assume that is 2 boxes of 90 packs for each eye. That means $102.50 CAD per box. I did know before that this independent optical store has extremely fair prices on glasses and contact lenses, but that was surprising. I know all the online contact lenses retailers are severely overpriced compared to this optical store. 

Does Costco not have the best prices on contact lenses in Canada? Is the no fitting exam fee the advantage when it comes to contact lenses at Costco?

I recently applied for a meat cutter position at Costco and was told the only way to become one would be to either work in the meat department not as a cutter or to wait and see if any new locations open up that are willing to bring in outside hires. If I went with route 1 I'd be taking a decent pay cut and come in hoping I'd eventually get the position I want. My questions for anyone who is currently or has been a meat cutter with Costco is: 

1) Is it worth taking the pay cut to come in at their minimum and hope a spot eventually opens up? 

2) How long does it typically take for people to move up into a meat cutter position?

Most of the time it works out, since larger packaging means less waste. However, there are definitely a few exceptions I can think about. Drinks are a big one. Coke and La Croix both use cardboard trays but plastic top wrapping, which is less ideal than the plain paperboard from regular grocery stores.

I'm deciding on a couple of job opportunities I've reached out for the interim to who aren't going to require me to work 5 days a week, and before I pull the trigger I'd like to ask how do I quit? 

May seem like a stupid question but I've never formally quit a job before (last job was like a small business type deal) and don't know how I go about it. Do I contact payroll first? Do I leave a letter in the GM's mailbox? I want to leave on good terms because I've been a good employee and will definitely need the reference for the specific career path I'm taking.

(Btw: For those about to say so, I'm aware Costco has an employee designation where you DON'T have to work 5 days a week as long as you have some kind of deserving circumstance and are approved by the GM, but my warehouse is notorious for leading employees on about it when they ask. One employee I know was straight up told she'd get it and it took like 10 follow-ups (with the managers and GM) over two months for her to finally work it out.

I did a big NO and dated a coworker. I know why people advise against it, and I know I messed up in doing so. We dated for a month max and then I realized that he wasn't the greatest person and broke it off. I privately asked him to keep it between us and told him we need to maintain professionalism at work.

Literally the day after we broke up my daughter came down with serious COVID symptoms and I wound up needing to take off to be with her.

Since the break up, which was roughly two weeks ago, he's gone off the deep end and completely slammed my reputation at work. Lied entirely about the reasons behind the break up. Got almost all of our coworkers far too involved. Keeps slamming me on Facebook. Pretty much every immature, petty thing a person could do after a break up to try and ruin the career of another... he's doing.

I've been contacted by five coworkers about the break up and I haven't even been back to work yet. I'm incredibly anxious about my return on Wednesday. It's now a hostile work environment because the messages I've been getting have ranged from simply unsympathetic and disappointed to straight up thinly veiled threats.

Is it worth a sit down with management to discuss what has been happening so that I don't walk into a minefield after two weeks of nursing a COVID positive four year old back to health? Aside from this, I'm a wonderful employee. I've been here almost a year. No conduct issues on my end. I want to keep enjoying my job but this is just unraveling it before my eyes.

And yes, I know, I messed up dating a coworker. But I feel like this is a pretty unfair price to pay for doing something that many people around the world do.

Costco,1619644706,n0p2mu,Costco Online = Terrible service,"On March 16, 2021, I placed an order for a washer and dryer that was later delivered on April the 2nd. True, I did not order a stacking kit cause I was not aware I needed one as my previous one did not require one. I was told to order a stacking kit from Costco or Amazon and as soon as I got it they will return to install it. I order the kit from Amazon as Costco did not sell it separately. After ordering the kit from Amazon I was told that they would not install a kit that does not come from any other place than Costco and I would also have to return the washer and dryer to Costco and make a new order with the stacking kit. I immediately went to Costco online and completed a return request. It's been 26 days and the washer and dryer are still sitting in my garage. I've been w/o a washer and dryer for over a month cause they took the old ones and I don't get the new order until the middle of next month.

A number of people chimed in asking the same question.  I bit the bullet and bought them, so here's information on them for anyone who wants.

https://www.costco.com/pendleton-national-park-collection-pillow%2c-2-pack.product.100752869.html

If you like not-fat pillows, these are perfect.  They're not much wider than the gusseted edge, and they're firm but not so hard you can't bend them and fold them if you want. (I sleep on my side and wedge them a little under my neck sometimes.)

I've been using them for five days now, and I'm going to buy another set so I have pillows on hand that work for me when this set wears out. (I have such a hard time finding pillows that are comfortable, when I find some that work for me, I like to buy extras.)

As for why they're a ""national park collection"", the colors on the side are the colors of (in this case) Pendleton National Park. Apparently the collection has other colors, but these are the only ones Costco carries.  (Edit: Since I ordered mine, Costco added three more color options!) Also, some money from each purchase is donated to the parks.

While these get a big thumbs up from me, pillows are a really personal item.  If you like a not-fat, solid pillow, check these out!  Side sleeper me loves them.",1.0,1,11

I ordered and received a set a few weeks ago and have enjoyed seeing them in my yard. They're fairly large. The colors vary some between the leaves: in the promo pic on the website (pic 1) you can see that some are predominantly orange while others have more purple or blue. Most of mine are the purple/blue variety (pic 2), though the colors change a little bit based on how light hits them.

What this means, is that the minimum cost to replace a tire under the road hazard will be 50 dollars, regardless of what size/make if it was purchased with a coupon. We had a member 3 days ago come in with 3000 miles on a tire and it cost them 60 dollars to replace it UNDER WARRANTY.

The lady tells me no and to wait 3-7 business days. 8 business days go by I get no email or call. So I decide to call them and they told me to get a police report. I get a police report that same day the 15th. The item arrived the 6th of this month (April) to give you all a time frame. I call them back and send this information to the costco investigations team. I was told to wait 1-2 business days for a email.

* Malbec Wine: genuinely good and amazing for the price
* Prosecco: great for brunch mimosas/bellinis, but a bit sweet on it's own for me personally (others i know IRL disagree)
* Irish Whisky, cheap and good. Not the best but i'd make whisky sours for this easily. 
* 12yo Scotch (not the best I've tried but amazing for the price. I don't feel guilty sipping this on a random night).  
* Irish Cream: Just as good as bailey's 
* Boxed Red Cabernet: I use this for pan sauces and sangría. It does the job well. Not the best wine for depth of flavor though

I got hold of a bag of Honey Roasted Macadamia Nuts, and got hooked!  They disappeared so quickly.

I sent her a couple of bags just to share.... and she told me the following:

I opened the bag, took a handful.. went back to the living room, and watched TV while snacking on them. After they were gone, I went back for another handful, went back to my TV show, and finished those off.  I did it a third time... grabbed a handful, watched TV, and devoured them.

  
The fourth time, I just brought the bag inside and killed off most of it before I finally went to bed!

If I bring my new wheels off the car to the tire shop, they should install them right? But if I bring the car in to get them rotated or something, they'll maybe decline? I guess mostly what I'm asking is what is their current policy on aftermarket wheels and tires. Does it vary per store?

Costco,1619319777,mxzfp1,Costco Auto botched. I don't blame Costco,"Was contacted by two dealerships via emails, phone calls and texts. Made appointment with Mazda dealer A. Via text Mazda rep A said that dealer B was going out of business and didn't know why Mazda dealer B was still part of the network.

 Today I arrived at dealership A, was shown the same quote, same Vin, produced Costco card, took a test drive (different VIN). Went back in to finalize price. Sales rep asked about financing, told her I was pre-approved thru the Credit Union I'm employed at. She left, came back and said she made a mistake with the quote. Said they couldn't take a 10k hit on price. I left and called the 2nd dealer to meet.

 I verified his earlier-in-the-week quote and make and model + year for clarity. His reply was yeah they only make Carbon Edition CX-9 for 2021. Again I texted rep 20 minutes later at Mazda dealership B with price CX-9 Carbon Edition. His reply was ""Yes"" and I said I'll be there in 30 minutes. ""sounds good"".  18 minutes later I get a call, text, email that said he mis-quoted me but at least he gave me new Costco pricing and didn't just push the MSRP in front of me like Mazda dealership A.

I called Costco so I could get a different dealership to provide quotes for next week. The rep was wonderful. She asked what happened at the first two, and showed genuine concern. I explained the above and apparently a consumer advocate will call me soon.

This is my first experience of purchasing a new car. I did the homework, got my pre approval loan package in place, secured insurance (paid in advance to begin today) and researched &amp; employed Costco Auto. I'm a bit tired, but not mad.

Costco,1619136374,mwijjk,Costco online offered discount on damaged item,"We purchased a $4000 Sofa and loveseat seat from Costco online 5 weeks ago.

There was one delivery delay after another and it finally arrived today.  

The arm of the loveseat has 5 small, half-inch inch visible cuts/perforations in it.  The delivery guys saw it and I told me to log it on the receipt/acknowledgment form, which I did.

I called Costco this evening and they said the item was out of stock and they could not offer a replacement and would only accept a return of both items as they are a set.

 They then offered $75 dollars compensation in lieu of a return.

I thought this sounded weird, and when I expressed I just wanted a replacement loveseat, but would have to return because for $4k the damage wasn't acceptable they said ""how about $110""?

Is this normal? 

I dont even know what the fair compensation value is for a damaged loveseat on a $4k set, but I know it's not $100 .  Furthermore, I simply just want the damaged piece of furniture replaced!

Basically the way I do it now is when fresh I eat both legs and wings in one meal with some rice and veggies. Out of one half of the breast, I can make about 3 sandwiches (I like the breast on sandwiches more than stand alone). I’ll have a sandwich usually for lunch and dinner the next day and lunch the third day. At this point, the chicken is about 3 days old and I still have half the breast plus two thighs left. At this point I may be able to make dinner the third day with it but the chicken isn’t as good really and by the fourth day I feel it’s sketchy to eat the rest so I usually end up throwing about 1/4 of it away. 

This is  pretty wasteful, usually not a concern because it’s so cheap but I really am trying to cut down on food waste and it’s just not efficient how I tackle this chicken. What would be a good strategy to eat this thing whole before it goes bad, without over-eating?",1.0,1,11

My wife and I had sent Costco's model of the KitchenAid 6-quart mixer to her father for his birthday, and when he first went to use it, the motor couldn't regulate speed.

We contacted Costco online to see about simply exchanging the bad mixer for a new one, but they're out of stock for the red color, and are therefore insisting on a refund-only; apparently the different color qualifies it as a different item in their system. We actually don't care what color we get at this point; we got it on a sale for $80 less than its current price, and therefore don't want to refund and re-purchase at a higher price.

Has anyone had success moving around this blockade? From our perspective, we just want a working mixer of any color at the price we originally paid.

Every sectional I look at seems to have a good number of positive reviews but many negative ones that make me very hesitant to pull the trigger. A few things that are often mentioned and would be a big deal to me are inadequate seat depth, cushions being too firm and never softening up, and lack of durability (fabrics quickly developing wear marks/foam not rebounding/etc.)

No preference between fabric or leather, although if I go leather, I definitely want top grain and won't cheap out. My favorite fabric option is the [Langdon](https://www.costco.com/.product.1356640.html), and my favorite leather option is the [Luca](https://www.costco.com/.product.1351194.html)

A lot of reviews also specifically mention this brand that it has this particular odor.

Costco,1618724669,mt72ao,Purchased the Lovesac deal from Costco. Here's my experience.,"After eyeing the Lovesac bundles on Costco for almost a year, we finally opted to pull the trigger during this most recent event. Now several days in, we are really happy with it and since I've seen some mixed reviews, I wanted to share my experience. 

We placed the order on Friday from Costco and almost immediately received confirmation from Costco and then Lovesac themselves. Costco's website is not specifying all the items included in the bundle but we called Lovesac directly to confirm and you ARE receiving all the bells and whistles given in previous roadshows (coasters, table, citysac, etc). All throughout the processing and shipping process, we continued to receive prompt and thorough communication from Lovesac directly. Most of our items showed up less than 6 days later, despite a quote of 3-4 weeks. The citysac is back ordered so we are still awaiting this item. 

Now less than 2 weeks after the order was placed I am sitting on the couch typing this review. We are thrilled with the experience and purchase. I believe there are several factors that contributed to this being a successful experience:

* we have the privilege of having 2 Lovesac stores within driving distance, and we made sure to go more than once to test drive the merchandise and ask lots of questions. Sitting on the seat is key and really think about how you'll be using it. We're binge movie watchers and parents of a 2 year old so comfort long term and durability are key for us. We found both so far here. 
* I asked questions to the salespeople directly, and confirmed over the phone. This refers to the first time I went in to Lovesac to ask if Lovesac still honors their warranty with items purchased through Costco. That salesman said no. I called corporate to confirm and they let me know that was not the case and that once you purchase from Costco, everything is fulfilled by them directly and handled directly, same as any other Lovesac purchase. Now that I have received my order I can confirm this was exactly the case. The only thing I would involve Costco in is if I had wanted to return my purchase. 
* I read lots online and watched some of the youtube review videos. 
* I went in with the expectation there would be tons of boxes and there were. We made sure to have our old couch cleared out an open space for the incoming boxes. We watched Lovesac's 3 Youtube videos on unboxing, putting on covers and assembling to help us put everything together. We kept our workspace clean as the videos suggested, breaking down boxes and grouping like items. We found it to be stress-free and a very easy process. If we HADN'T know there would be 30 huge boxes coming, however, I can see how that would cause so much stress. 
* I knew that this Costco bundle only allowed for the choice of standard inserts and would not allow (as purchased) for the deep seat. You have to purchase the deep sides for the deep seat. I saw a lot of people making returns because of this reason. Now keep in mind - the seats included in this bundle WILL work for a deep seat. You just will have to purchase a deep side (or several, depending on formation) for the deep sit. If you don't know this, hear it here. If you have the ability to go into the store and try it out - do so. I am shorter than my husband and found I prefer a deeper seat. He is 6'4 and didn't mind the standard seat, however, he is a couch layer so that is what he was excited about. I got around my neep for a deep seat by designating my side the ottoman side and that has been working out tremendously for us so far. 

I can confirm after shopping around and in-store that you're not going to find a better deal than the Costco deal if you like the colors the bundle is being offered in. The coasters are fantastic, the table is functional both on the pillows OR as a lap table (fits my laptop, phone, beverage and room for more!) and the blankets are AMAZING - heavy, warm and so chic. The sqattoman is actually really cute and comfortable. The included throw pillows are large and squashy and even the basic covering that comes included is growing on me. My son was excited by the furry nature of the squattoman so I can't wait until he sees the Citysac and loses his mind. All in all, we are really happy and it's great to have gotten something new that I wanted for such a smoke show deal. If you're considering making this purchase, hopefully this post helps you out!",1.0,1,33

I've always had very positive experiences shopping at Costco. That said, we purchased a dishwasher online. It was a great deal, especially when ""white glove delivery and installation"" are included in the price...however, things did not turn out as nicely as I'd expected. 

Costco  has great prices on major appliances, but their delivery and  installation is the worst I have ever encountered. Who delivers a  dishwasher with promised ""white glove delivery and installation"" and  then just leaves the appliance in a box in the garage and informs the  customer that the actual installation is scheduled for a week after the  delivery date?! Add to that the fact that Costco does not do uninstalls  of dishwashers (or any ""built-in"" appliances), so we'll be washing  dishes by hand for a week, because we paid a plumber to do the uninstall  the day before the dishwasher was expected.

 A call to ""Costco logistics"" only served to confirm that there were ""no  installers available"" for the next week. A subsequent call to Costco  customer service resulted in a $25 credit to the card used for the  purchase. $25...so Costco is willing to pay me $25 to wash our own  dishes by hand for a week (about $3.50 per day)!

I asked since the product I bought is inferior and from the same company if they could please give me at least a $200 dollar discount and the response is no.

Their solution is to have me remove the dishwasher myself. Bring it to the warehouse and return it, then wait for the new dishwasher to come and be installed by their team.

We all really appreciate you and you're the best part of our trip. Thanks for being there and chatting us up when checking out. 

I love that idea. It's time to expand it asap to every Costco and then work on taking it in the store so you can just hold it up to the reader. I use Apple Pay inside Costco probably most don't and this could speed up lines. You scan the fob for your membership and if you agree with the price hit ""yes"", grab your receipt and go away (with your mask still on hopefully). 

I love Costco and I love the people who work there. They are very fast and they literally make shopping there better but imagine how much better it would be if they could just skip one step.

I know Costco isn't that huge on tech stuff but one of the reasons I also shop at Sam's Club is the Scan &amp; Go feature. I love walking by everyone in the store and just heading for the door. It saves a damn ton of time and that has to save them money. I don't compare Sam's and Costco in terms of anything other than that. They are not the same. I shop at Sam's for the stuff that Costco doesn't carry. 

As much as I just love Costco as much as all of you it really is a nightmare to actually pull in and go shopping. I don't want them to really change that much because when places do, they turn into freaking Kmart. Have you been in a Kmart in the last 10 years? They are the Kohls of Walmart's and that is why they are going to shit. Costco is so much better than that and smarter. But they one thing they can for sure improve on is payment options to save time.

Costco,1618000577,mnq3in,Disappointed by KS for the first time: KS Dishwasher Pacs,"I've always been a KS fan, and I really wanted the KS Dishwasher Pacs (abbreviated to KSDP for brevity below) to be my new go-to.  I  bought them almost a month ago and I'm disappointed.  Facts:

* Previously used Cascade and didn't have any complaints except occasional large pieces (own fault)
* Switched to KSDP expecting similar performance for lower cost (typical KS proposition)
* We moved to a new apartment shortly after switching to the KSDP and I noticed that more fine particle residue was sticking to the dishes.  
* I continued using KSDP for a month thinking that the new dishwasher was the culprit (went from Whirlpool to GE)
* After researching, found similar experience from others and decided to exchange remaining pods for Cascade Complete
* Zero food residue with Cascade Complete since

Observations:

* I think Costco tried to do too much with the product, it advertises that it's safe for septic systems and chlorine free which may limit it's cleaning power (how big could the septic market be that they thought they needed to address it?)
* It seems Costco has realized this as well as they now have a new version in store that advertises ""30% more cleaning power and better fitting pods."" 

I mostly wrote this as a vent post and also to inform others.  I'd be interested to see if anyone has tried the new version and seen better results; I was tempted but I dislike dirty dishes and so gave it a pass for now.",1.0,1,0

I got a set of new tires installed on my Prius and had a set of OEM replacement TPMS sensors installed at the same time (that I purchased separately), the tire manager claimed that their equipment was not compatible with any sensor that they do not sell. Is this BS? 

Is this just costco being cheap (like no windshield squeegees at the gas pumps)?  
Or do they purposefully purchase tools that are not compatible with 95% of TPMS sensors?

I would be fine with it if they had just said that it was their policy to not program TPMS sensors that they did not sell, but it seems like they were lying to me (claiming that the equipment was not capable of it).

\-rant over
